Authors answered this issue but they did not specify it in their manuscript. Such choice is a very important bias, as the choice is neither random nor based on any criteria.

The resolution is too low to be able to see what length the scale bar actually represents.4. Reproducibility should be discussed . Were the catalysts prepared and tested several times? Standard deviations for the obtained data should be presented where possible, in particular Figures 9-10 where the CO conversion is presented.5.

CO oxidation (in particular at low temperature) is pivotal to the abatement of exhaust gases and therefore ties in well with the increasingly important sustainability efforts in catalysis. A general paragraph on sustainability should be added  to the introduction. Briefly mention the different fields of sustainable solutions via catalysis such as biorefinery (10.1039/C8GC04017F), organocatalysis (10.1021/acscatal.8b01706), waste valorization (10.1039/C9GC00902G), hydrogen evolution (10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b05302), natural laterite (10.1021/acsanm.8b01117).7.

The recovery and reusability of the catalysts should be discussed  in the text. Have the authors performed any repeated experiments on used catalysts? Have they observed any performance decline? What are the criteria for reusing the catalysts? What is the expected lifetime of the catalysts?9. In order to minimize waste and address the sustainability requirements, the authors should mention that the isopropanol could be recycled  using sustainable membrane technologies (solvent recycling) and mention 10.1016/j.jcat.2019.01.041 example.10.

Population based evolutionary approaches, such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs) or Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), are able to detect in a fast way the main regions of attraction while their local search abilities represent a major drawback [11] from the point of view of the solution accuracy and of the convergence behaviour, specially when applied to multimodal problems.

Several factors may have contributed to this result, including: the distance of UCE pilot event locations from public transit, the lack of culturally relevant messaging, the lack of Spanish-speaking staff at events, and the lack of trusted messengers participating in events. To address the lack of demographic representation among participants, subsequent expansion efforts should include more direct engagement with trusted members of the targeted communities and stronger attempts to engage participants in energy efficiency education.'.

Other methods include but are not limited to biochemical method [11], molecular sieving [12,13], and low-temperature fractionation [14,15]. Among those technologies listed above, chemical absorption is the most widely used method for acid gas removal. Various amines have been commonly used as chemical solvents, such as monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), and methyldiethanolamine (MDEA). Compared with MEA and DEA, MDEA can selectively remove H2S with the existence of CO2. Secondly, MDEA can remove most CO2 and H2S from the raw natural gas, it can be beneficial to sulfur recovery. Thirdly, the foaming tendency and corrosiveness of MDEA are lower compared to MEA and DEA.

'Software trustworthiness is the ability of software to satisfy user expectation with its behaviors and results and to still provide continuous services by disturbances [1]. It can be characterized  by many software attributes [1\u20137], which are referred to as trustworthy attributes. Software trustworthiness measurement describes how to determine the trustworthy degree of software based on the given trustworthy attributes\u2019 values and their weight values. It can provide a basis for guiding and improving  the trustworthiness of design and implementation of software. Therefore, software trustworthiness measurement becomes one of the core scientific problems in the researching on software trustworthiness [1]. Many software trustworthiness measures based on trustworthy attributes are established, including questionnaires and statistical analysis [8,9], axiomatic approaches [10\u201316], evidence theory [17], supervised machine learning [18], maximum entropy and grey decision-making method [19], software behaviour entropy [20], system testing [21], social-to-software framework [22], crowd wisdom [23], heuristic-systematic processing model [24], users feedback [25], STRAM (Security, Trust, Resilience, and Agility Metrics) [26], etc.' I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 26 (like the authors have did) or even more scientific works in a few lines just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section.

They are not efficient and produce considerable amounts of impurities and pollutants which have a negative effect on the environment [4,5]. [\u2026] They do not reduce emission of pollutants generated by technological systems of heat sources [6,7]. [\u2026] Solutions with recuperators can include devices installed as separate elements of the technological system of the heat source [8\u201311] or devices which constitute an integral part of the combustion chamber, e.g., in condensing boilers [11,12]. Recently, systems with compressor or sorption heat pumps for the recovery and reuse of waste heat have been used most frequently [13,14]. An interesting concept of using an adsorption heat pump for reusing the heat generated by a district heating system in the summer period, when the heat is treated as waste heat, was discussed in [15]. However, the solutions for heat recovery with the use of recuperators and/or heat pumps do not in any way affect changes in the combustion gas composition, thus they do not contribute to the reduction of environmental burden caused by heat sources. This is a serious disadvantage of these solutions in comparison to the installation described herein, which enhances energy efficiency of boilers and reduces emission of pollutants and impurities, including solid impurities. Methods of improving control systems in heating boilers are also often applied in order to enhance energy efficiency of heat sources [16\u201319].

In 2015, the European Commission (institution of the European Union, to whom Belgium is a member country since 1958) has adopted new electricity market rules in order to allow efficient EU-wide electricity trading and to bring the goal of a well-integrated EU internal energy market a step closer. The Regulation was published in the EU\u2019s Official Journal on 25th July 2015 and entered into effect on 14th August 2015. The Regulation has created a comprehensive legal framework for electricity trading in Europe and has made so-called 'market coupling' legally binding across the EU. The Regulation is part of the Commission's project to create an Energy Union with a truly integrated electricity market. These rules establish a new decision-making procedure which enables effective regional cooperation among grid operators, power exchanges and regulators.
