5863	The manuscript by Janus and co-workers details the measurement of photocatalytic activity of building materials, in particular gypsum. The results are interesting, have some novelty, and fits well the scope of Catalysts. However, there are some technical and contextualization issues that should be addressed  prior to further consideration by the journal.	{"299, 308, ACTION","289, 295, MODAL","4, 14, LOCATION","221, 228, TRIGGER","246, 283, CONTENT"}

5866	3. The photocatalytic activity of building materials ties in well with the increasingly important sustainability efforts. A general paragraph on sustainability should be added  to the introduction. Briefly mention the different fields of sustainable solutions via catalysis such as biorefinery (Green Chem., 2019, 21, 1668-1679), organocatalysis (ACS Catal. 2018, 8, 7430-7438), waste valorization (Green Chem., 2019, 21, 4217-4230), hydrogen evolution (ACS Sustainable Chem.

5870	The manuscript entitled „Development of Vitamin-D Toxicity from Overcorrecting Vitamin-D Deficiency: Case Review” presents very important and current issue, but it requires the really major corrections.	{"4, 14, LOCATION","24, 113, LOCATION","164, 172, ACTION","177, 201, CONTENT"}
5871	The manuscript requires more careful formatting, as the study is in general shabbily prepared, including the typesetting (e.g. line 40 – track changes version; Figure 2 – should not be presented  next to the text, but under the text of the paragraph).	{"4, 15, LOCATION","52, 61, LOCATION","178, 194, ACTION","160, 168, LOCATION","240, 249, LOCATION","106, 120, CONTENT","126, 135, LOCATION","218, 232, LOCATION","24, 47, CONTENT","171, 178, MODAL","76, 93, ACTION","196, 212, LOCATION","15, 24, ACTION"}
5872	Authors should use more scientific vocabulary and language, while they should avoid colloquial phrases (e.g.“sunshine vitamin”,“vitamin pills” – supplementation is a more specific phrase), as well as not scientific language “vitamin D [has] been related with the well-being of our bones”).	{"15, 19, ACTION","60, 65, TRIGGER","108, 126, LOCATION","127, 142, LOCATION","189, 199, TRIGGER","200, 223, CONTENT","224, 287, LOCATION","84, 102, CONTENT","78, 84, ACTION","71, 78, MODAL","19, 58, CONTENT","8, 15, MODAL"}

5877	Lines 20-28 – The paragraphs should be removed , as they present basic and obvious information, that are well known for the readers of Nutrients and sometimes even trivial “vitamin D [has] been related with the well-being of our bones”)	{"39, 47, ACTION","18, 28, LOCATION","52, 56, LOCATION","57, 94, CONTENT","29, 36, MODAL","0, 11, LOCATION","172, 235, LOCATION"}
5878	Lines 24-40 – should be significantly shortened , as the paragraph also presents the basic information, that are not related directly to the aim of the study. Instead of this information, Authors should rather present the recommendations of intake, including supplementation recommendations (in USA and other countries), as well as information about dietary intake	{"57, 66, LOCATION","332, 364, CONTENT","218, 319, CONTENT","321, 331, TRIGGER","50, 52, TRIGGER","14, 21, MODAL","0, 11, LOCATION","159, 169, TRIGGER","210, 218, ACTION","196, 203, MODAL","38, 48, ACTION"}

5893	The manuscript by Arias et al. details the design of a membrane cascade for gas separation. The work has some novelty, it has a good amount of data, and the topic is of interest to a broad audience including chemical engineers, process engineers and professionals working in the membrane field. The work fits well the scope of the journal. However, there are several issues that must be addressed  prior to further consideration by Processes. The manuscript needs to be reconsidered after carefully addressing all the comments listed below:	{"379, 383, MODAL","340, 347, TRIGGER","387, 396, ACTION","447, 457, LOCATION","359, 373, CONTENT","4, 14, LOCATION"}

5902	9) The accuracy of the applied methods as well as the obtained numerical results should be thought through and considered  in the presentation of data. For instance, when 75.95% is reported, is it appropriate to report percentages down to two decimal places? The accuracy should not be more than a percent.	{"91, 106, ACTION","171, 177, LOCATION","191, 257, CONTENT","130, 150, LOCATION","3, 80, CONTENT","296, 305, CONTENT","279, 295, ACTION","166, 170, TRIGGER","272, 278, MODAL","81, 88, MODAL","111, 123, ACTION"}

As they adjusted it for season (the most important factor influencing vitamin D status), they should also have adjusted it for vitamin D intake. The vitamin D intake may be for individuals characterized  by high fish intake even more important than sunlight exposure, so especially for Portugal (characterized by quite high fish intake) – this assessment may be very important. If Authors do not have such results, they should discuss it extensively and indicate it as a possible problem and a reason of lack of significant association (as it was not included into adjustment).	{"678, 745, CONTENT","637, 644, ACTION","630, 636, MODAL","333, 353, CONTENT","316, 329, ACTION","304, 310, MODAL","147, 208, CONTENT","88, 116, CONTENT","126, 140, ACTION","9, 17, ACTION","73, 87, ACTION","25, 30, LOCATION","311, 315, TRIGGER","673, 675, CONTENT","588, 590, TRIGGER","645, 647, CONTENT","591, 623, CONTENT","664, 672, ACTION"}

5977	Author Contributions: This section is very confusing, as Authors declared contributions that are not included to their study – e.g. “validation” – they did not validate any method, so this contribution is not adequate, or they declared contributions which should be rather indicated  in their Acknowledgements section (e.g. “Funding acquisition”) – as a result, it seems as a “guest authorship” procedure which is forbidden. At the same time, Authors declared only preparing original draft here, with no revisions and constructive comments by other Authors (does it mean that other Authors are not familiar with the text? Does it mean that Authors submitted draft of their manuscript, not the final manuscript?)	{"189, 201, CONTENT","627, 709, CONTENT","563, 620, CONTENT","250, 255, TRIGGER","411, 423, ACTION","376, 404, CONTENT","460, 464, TRIGGER","152, 168, ACTION","57, 124, CONTENT","54, 56, TRIGGER","43, 52, ACTION","132, 144, LOCATION","219, 221, TRIGGER","236, 249, CONTENT","169, 179, CONTENT","256, 262, MODAL","22, 34, LOCATION","324, 345, LOCATION","622, 627, TRIGGER","558, 563, TRIGGER","293, 317, LOCATION","273, 284, ACTION","0, 20, LOCATION","181, 183, TRIGGER","205, 217, ACTION"}

6007	Based on Authors Contributions section, some Authors did almost nothing for the manuscript preparation itself. Such persons should be not indicated  as Authors of the study. Authors should remember, that the“guest authorship” is the forbidden procedure. Authors who did not participate in the manuscript preparing should be removed at all or just be presented  in Acknowledgements Section. If they participated actively in the study and creating manuscript, as well as performed critical revisions of the manuscript and accepted the publication of the data, they should be indicated , but their contributions should be clearly specified .	{"124, 131, MODAL","182, 188, MODAL","469, 556, CONTENT","458, 468, TRIGGER","585, 588, TRIGGER","595, 608, CONTENT","167, 172, LOCATION","347, 359, ACTION","393, 456, CONTENT","339, 341, TRIGGER","80, 90, LOCATION","111, 123, CONTENT","293, 303, LOCATION","390, 392, TRIGGER","254, 285, CONTENT","152, 159, CONTENT","233, 242, ACTION","627, 637, ACTION","609, 616, MODAL","573, 583, ACTION","563, 570, MODAL","364, 388, LOCATION","324, 332, ACTION","314, 321, MODAL","134, 147, ACTION","9, 38, LOCATION"}
6008	1) The use of informal expressions should be avoided  in the manuscript, e.g. Lines 32, 74:“As everyone knows”,“So it would be a good idea”	{"91, 110, LOCATION","61, 71, LOCATION","111, 139, LOCATION","78, 90, LOCATION","45, 53, ACTION","35, 41, MODAL","3, 34, CONTENT"}
6009	2) The Abstract and the Conclusion are very similar. The Abstract should be rewritten focusing less on the results and summarizing  the whole of the research. It should contain: motivation, problem statement, approach, (some) results and implications… in a brief and concise manner.	{"39, 51, CONTENT","100, 157, CONTENT","66, 73, MODAL","86, 99, ACTION","7, 16, LOCATION","76, 86, ACTION","24, 35, LOCATION","162, 169, MODAL","169, 176, ACTION","178, 281, CONTENT","57, 66, LOCATION"}
6010	3) The toxicity and environmental effects of cadmium are discussed in details with excessive referencing in the Introduction, albeit the article is not about studying these aspects. The toxicity should be mentioned  in a single sentence with a single reference to a review or book.	{"112, 124, LOCATION","205, 216, ACTION","195, 202, MODAL","219, 280, CONTENT","182, 194, CONTENT","126, 132, TRIGGER"}
6011	4) The introduction should focus more on the similar research on imprinted polymers for cadmium scavenging  and for wastewater treatment (J. Hazard. Mater., 164, 2009, 1547-1551; Green Chem., 2015, 17, 5196-5205; Chem. Eng. J. 171, 2011, 703).	{"20, 27, MODAL","138, 241, CONTENT","41, 136, CONTENT","7, 20, LOCATION","27, 33, ACTION"}
6012	5) The Introduction should include a critical statement about the existing cadmium scavenging  technologies to verify the need for the presented work. What are the problems with the current adsorbents? Why/how will be the new adsorbent in this paper better than those?	{"20, 27, MODAL","210, 267, CONTENT","202, 209, TRIGGER","159, 200, CONTENT","151, 156, TRIGGER","37, 107, CONTENT","7, 20, LOCATION","27, 35, ACTION"}
6013	6) The numbers in chemical formulas should be written in subscript, e.g.“CdCl2” should be corrected  to“CdCl2”.	{"80, 87, MODAL","72, 79, LOCATION","3, 35, CONTENT","103, 110, CONTENT","36, 43, MODAL","46, 54, ACTION","57, 66, CONTENT","90, 101, ACTION"}
6014	7) Instead of“et al.” the authors should use“etc.” to express the non-exhaustiveness of a list, e.g. Lines 35, 55, 151	{"66, 94, CONTENT","41, 44, ACTION","54, 62, ACTION","3, 10, TRIGGER","101, 118, LOCATION","44, 50, CONTENT","13, 21, LOCATION","34, 41, MODAL"}
6015	8) The Experimental description should be more detailed . For instance, what was the concentration and volume of the concentrated hydrochloric acid in the desorption experiment? Were the three-times repeated experiments performed with independently prepared adsorbents or with the same batch of adsorbent?	{"47, 56, ACTION","187, 304, CONTENT","178, 183, TRIGGER","84, 176, CONTENT","77, 81, TRIGGER","32, 39, MODAL","3, 31, CONTENT"}
6016	9) A large part of the experimental data is presented with more significant figures than that of the accuracy of the technique would justify. Revise and correct the accuracy of these data (E.g. IR wavenumbers, Kd, k, ?, temperature, ?G, ?H, ?S, qe, desorption ratio, adsorption capacity decrease).	{"153, 161, ACTION","142, 149, ACTION","161, 187, CONTENT","194, 295, CONTENT"}
6017	12) The panels of figures should be better organised . Please present the panels of Fig. 2 in 2x2 while the panels of Fig. 4 next to each other (1x2).	{"108, 124, LOCATION","62, 70, ACTION","43, 53, ACTION","125, 149, CONTENT","7, 25, LOCATION","26, 33, MODAL","94, 97, CONTENT","74, 90, LOCATION"}
6018	14) Line 40:“Among all the heavy metal ions, cadmium was listed as the sixth most poisonous substance” This statement should be supported  by a relevant reference. There is no such statement in the article cited: Das et al., 1997.	{"12, 102, LOCATION","4, 11, LOCATION","198, 205, LOCATION","118, 125, MODAL","128, 139, ACTION","144, 162, CONTENT","213, 229, CONTENT","103, 117, CONTENT"}
6019	15) Cadmium should be written in lower case without italic style.	{"12, 19, MODAL","22, 43, ACTION","4, 11, LOCATION","44, 64, ACTION"}
6020	16) In Lines 224-227, the authors explain why the Langmuir and Freundlich models are not adequate to study adsorption in solid-liquid systems. What is the rationale behind performing these analyses? Furthermore, the thermodynamic parameters derived from Langmuir and SDT-A models should be compared and the difference should be discussed .	{"216, 279, CONTENT","303, 317, CONTENT","280, 287, MODAL","7, 20, LOCATION","328, 338, ACTION","199, 210, TRIGGER","143, 148, TRIGGER","318, 325, MODAL","151, 197, CONTENT","290, 299, ACTION"}
6021	17) Lines 253-260. This paragraph is confusing and difficult to follow, and needs to be rephrased.	{"19, 33, LOCATION","76, 82, MODAL","88, 97, ACTION","4, 17, LOCATION"}
6022	18) Correct“kJmol” to“kJ/mol” everywhere in the footnote of Table 3.	{"11, 18, LOCATION","47, 56, LOCATION","60, 67, LOCATION","21, 29, CONTENT","4, 11, ACTION"}
6023	20) Line 109:“The pH of Cd(II) solution was adjusted to the range of 2.0-10.0” -> This information seems erroneous as in Fig. 4, pH values from 1.5 to 13 are depicted.	{"13, 78, LOCATION","115, 117, TRIGGER","4, 12, LOCATION","121, 127, LOCATION","82, 98, CONTENT","99, 114, ACTION","129, 166, CONTENT"}
6024	21) Line 111:“the IB dosage changed from 1.0 to 10.0 g/L” -> This information seems erroneous as in Fig. S4, dosage values from 0.5 to 5.0 are depicted.	{"109, 151, CONTENT","78, 93, ACTION","61, 77, CONTENT","100, 107, LOCATION","13, 57, LOCATION","4, 12, LOCATION"}
6025	22) Although the results of zeta potential analysis are briefly summarized, the relevance of this analysis in relation to the proposed application should be clarified . The relevant findings of this analysis should be discussed .	{"208, 215, MODAL","218, 228, ACTION","173, 207, CONTENT","157, 167, ACTION","147, 154, MODAL","80, 146, CONTENT"}
6026	23) Section 3.2 is titled“Adsorption experiment results” while Section 3.3 is“Adsorption experiment”. The division into sections should be revised : either specific and distinct titles should be given to these sections, or they should be merged .	{"149, 184, CONTENT","238, 245, ACTION","228, 235, MODAL","220, 222, TRIGGER","102, 128, CONTENT","4, 15, LOCATION","25, 56, LOCATION","63, 74, LOCATION","129, 136, MODAL","139, 147, ACTION","210, 218, LOCATION","77, 100, LOCATION","185, 192, MODAL","195, 201, ACTION"}
6027	24) A section discussing the mathematical framework of this work should be created  in the Supporting Information. All the equations used for the fitting of different models should be introduced  in this section in the SI rather than under the Results and Discussion.	{"75, 84, ACTION","4, 64, CONTENT","91, 113, LOCATION","174, 181, MODAL","222, 233, TRIGGER","184, 196, ACTION","204, 212, LOCATION","244, 266, LOCATION","219, 221, LOCATION","115, 173, CONTENT","65, 72, MODAL"}
6028	25) The unit of adsorption capacity should be corrected  from“mg/L” to“mg/g” in both Fig. 2a and 4a.	{"85, 92, LOCATION","46, 57, ACTION","36, 43, MODAL","4, 35, CONTENT","61, 67, LOCATION","70, 76, CONTENT","97, 99, LOCATION"}
6029	26) Line 288:“The reduction of adsorption capacity may be due to the saturation of the adsorption active sites.” This statement seems erroneous. With higher adsorbent dosage more active sites are introduced thus the saturation of the adsorption active sites can be rejected . However, with higher adsorbent dosage more active sites compete for the same amount of Cd(II) ions therefore only the higher affinity active sites will be occupied  resulting in a decrease in adsorption capacity.	{"276, 283, TRIGGER","13, 112, LOCATION","4, 12, LOCATION","128, 143, ACTION","375, 384, TRIGGER","113, 127, CONTENT"}
6030	27) Line 291:“From the aspects of economic, 2.0 g/L adsorbent was selected as the optimum dose.” -> How was the economically optimal dose determined? What were the economic factors taken into consideration? Please elaborate, and provide evidence for the“economic” nature of the work, or refrain from this statement.	{"287, 295, ACTION","4, 12, LOCATION","237, 282, CONTENT","229, 237, ACTION","284, 286, TRIGGER","150, 154, TRIGGER","108, 148, CONTENT","100, 103, TRIGGER","13, 96, LOCATION","160, 205, CONTENT","214, 223, ACTION","305, 314, CONTENT"}
6031	28) At the end of Results and Discussion section, the adsorbent performance should be compared  to other similar adsorbents (imprinted or biochar based) from the literature.	{"50, 75, CONTENT","18, 48, LOCATION","99, 172, CONTENT","76, 83, MODAL","86, 96, ACTION"}
6032	29) Reference 14. (Hou et al.) seems to be incorrect as it is not about biochar source or production, thus the reference should be removed .	{"110, 120, CONTENT","121, 128, MODAL","131, 139, ACTION","19, 29, LOCATION","4, 16, LOCATION"}
6033	30) The referencing style should be uniform, revise and correct as necessary, e.g. full article names with capitals are used except“Braz.j.plant Physiol”,“Eur. J. Forest. Res.” and“Journal of geophysical research solid earth”.	{"131, 153, LOCATION","4, 25, CONTENT","26, 33, MODAL","56, 64, ACTION","45, 52, ACTION","83, 131, CONTENT","180, 225, LOCATION","154, 176, LOCATION"}
6034	31) The desorption isotherm and the adsorption desorption cycles should be depicted  in graphs instead in the text. The authors should mention and reference that the imprinted polymers can be recycled extensively under carefully selected  conditions (Polym. Chem., 2017, 8, 666-673).	{"75, 85, ACTION","162, 249, CONTENT","88, 94, CONTENT","110, 114, LOCATION","128, 135, MODAL","135, 143, ACTION","251, 281, CONTENT","65, 72, MODAL","4, 64, CONTENT","147, 157, ACTION"}
6035	32) Either the product form of units (J·mol·K-1) (preferably) or the quotient form (mg/L) should be consistently used  throughout the manuscript.	{"90, 97, MODAL","134, 144, LOCATION","65, 89, CONTENT","113, 119, ACTION","62, 64, TRIGGER","11, 61, CONTENT"}
6036	The manuscript entitled“Plant based fat, dietary patterns rich in vegetable fat and gut microbiota modulation” (previously entitled“Nuts, plant based fat sources and dietary patterns in microbiota modulation”) presents an interesting issue, but it requires really major corrections before being published.	{"241, 244, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","23, 110, LOCATION"}
6037	The main issue is associated with the fact, that Authors presented a highly subjective review of literature. They did not present properly inclusion criteria to qualify the studies to the review. Authors should precise the inclusion criteria and if the review was prepared based on the systematic review method, it must be specified  (as this method is the proper one, while the subjective narrative review is not).	{"18, 42, TRIGGER","249, 310, CONTENT","204, 211, MODAL","246, 248, TRIGGER","211, 219, ACTION","222, 241, CONTENT","323, 334, ACTION","315, 320, MODAL","139, 194, CONTENT","118, 138, ACTION","69, 86, ACTION","87, 107, CONTENT","9, 14, ACTION"}
6038	The inclusion criteria to qualify the studies to the review must be presented , in the separate Materials and Methods section, because the choice of studies to the review is quite unusual. Authors qualified both review articles and research articles, while a number of the qualified studies are not related to the nuts or fat (e.g. analyzing association between diet and diabetes).	{"96, 125, LOCATION","68, 78, ACTION","60, 64, MODAL","0, 59, CONTENT","251, 256, TRIGGER","127, 134, TRIGGER","136, 173, CONTENT","180, 187, ACTION"}

6045	4. Solvent stability obtained during immersion experiments are not as reliable as continuous filtration through the membrane and therefore it can be misleading  to report long-term stability merely based on immersion into solvents. The loss of polymer during immersion was also not reported. The authors should either carry out these experiments or be more critical with their data and mention these limitations and drawbacks.	{"304, 310, MODAL","328, 345, CONTENT","346, 348, TRIGGER","349, 365, ACTION","377, 381, CONTENT","386, 393, ACTION","393, 425, CONTENT","318, 327, ACTION"}

6047	6. Avoid vague expressions such as“strong stirring” and report quantitatively the procedures and results. In this case, what was the rpm of the stirrer and the duration of the agitation? Avoid using the word“obviously” as if something is obvious then it should not be stated  in a scientific article.

Flux of 118 was reported in the abstract and the conclusions, however, it is clear from the obtained data that this performance is not stable and it is just a first flux before the membrane conditioning / flux decline. Therefore, the stable flux obtained after days of filtration should be reported . Those are the actual flux values one can reliably use the membranes with.	{"36, 45, LOCATION","20, 29, ACTION","53, 64, LOCATION","4, 15, CONTENT","294, 303, ACTION","284, 291, MODAL","66, 73, TRIGGER","234, 284, CONTENT"}

The authors should provide a more extensive list of polymers used for nanofiltration in organic solvents, e.g. polybenzimidazole, polyether ether ketone, thermally rearranged polymers (Green Chem., 2016, 18, 2374-2384; J.

6056	16. The authors state that developing green methods to reuse organic solvents, i.e. solvent recovery is demanding (line 29). Recent examples and efforts for these with SRNF should be given: Nat.

6058	18. The duration of the filtration tests should be reported . Although not reported it seems that the membrane were only tested for a few minutes. How reliable are these measurement? The lack of long-term cross-flow studies should be critically mentioned  in the manuscript.	{"4, 40, CONTENT","51, 60, ACTION","151, 181, CONTENT","224, 231, MODAL","245, 256, ACTION","147, 151, TRIGGER","41, 48, MODAL","263, 273, LOCATION","183, 223, CONTENT"}

6060	20. The conclusions section should summarize the main research findings in a quantitative manner. The impact of the work should be emphasized . Possible leaching of lead from the composite material should be mentioned .	{"121, 128, MODAL","208, 218, ACTION","143, 197, CONTENT","198, 205, MODAL","45, 96, CONTENT","8, 27, LOCATION","35, 45, ACTION","28, 35, MODAL","98, 120, CONTENT","131, 142, ACTION"}
6061	1) The SEM images cannot be used  for drawing conclusions about the MIP/NIP relative porosity. Based on panel a) and b) the morphology of the two polymers are identical which is expected as the two polymers only differ in the presence of template during their preparation.	{"28, 32, ACTION","120, 271, CONTENT","18, 24, MODAL","34, 93, CONTENT","3, 17, CONTENT","117, 119, LOCATION","104, 112, LOCATION"}
6062	2) Magnification of 15k is mentioned in the caption of Figure 2, however 30k is written on the actual SEM image. Please clarify.	{"120, 127, ACTION","65, 72, TRIGGER","55, 63, LOCATION","91, 111, CONTENT","27, 37, ACTION","80, 88, ACTION","3, 23, CONTENT","44, 52, LOCATION","73, 76, CONTENT"}
6063	3) The entire manuscript needs to be revised for typos and grammar mistakes. e.g.‘synthesized method’ ->‘synthesis method’; what is meant by‘disturbing the template leakage’?	{"37, 45, ACTION","49, 75, CONTENT","140, 173, LOCATION","81, 101, LOCATION","104, 122, CONTENT","124, 128, TRIGGER","14, 25, LOCATION"}
6064	4) Vague expressions and sentences should be avoided . Examples in the abstract:‘The synthesized method was easy, simple, and reproducible.’ -> This sentence is subjective and should be deleted or rephrased  in a quantitative way.‘showed good selectivity’ -> The actual selectivity factor should be mentioned .	{"80, 140, LOCATION","230, 255, LOCATION","259, 288, CONTENT","35, 42, MODAL","45, 53, ACTION","144, 157, CONTENT","71, 79, LOCATION","3, 34, CONTENT","176, 183, MODAL","186, 194, ACTION","197, 208, ACTION","208, 229, CONTENT","289, 296, MODAL","299, 309, ACTION"}
6065	5) The introduction should cover the MIP literature on environmental/water works (e.g. Analytica Chimica Acta, 610, 2008, 35-43; Green Chemistry, 17, 2015, 5196-5205; Journal of Chromatography A, 1073, 2005, 363-370; Ind.

6066	6) The authors repeatedly mention that the use of dummy templates can avoid the risk of leakage (see abstract, introduction, results and conclusion sections). This sentence needs to be rephrased as the leakage of the employed template cannot be avoided . What they meant is that the target analyte would not contaminate the samples as they do not leach from the polymers (however the dummy-template can still leak from the polymer).	{"255, 259, TRIGGER","101, 109, LOCATION","137, 147, LOCATION","39, 95, LOCATION","198, 252, CONTENT","279, 370, CONTENT","195, 197, TRIGGER","173, 178, MODAL","159, 172, LOCATION","185, 195, ACTION","271, 278, TRIGGER","111, 123, LOCATION","260, 270, CONTENT","125, 133, LOCATION"}

6068	8) Reusability of imprinted polymers is an important and necessary feature. The authors should comment on the recycle/reusability of their MIPs, and mention their potential over long term as imprinted polymers can be reused over a long time under carefully selected conditions which should be mentioned   (Polym. Chem., 2017, 8, 666-673) under section 2.5.	{"344, 355, LOCATION","283, 290, MODAL","110, 143, CONTENT","293, 302, ACTION","163, 187, CONTENT","95, 102, ACTION","88, 95, MODAL","149, 156, ACTION","306, 336, CONTENT","191, 276, CONTENT"}
6069	9) The resolution of Figure 4 is low making it impossible to read the legend and subsequently interpret the data presented.	{"3, 17, CONTENT","30, 36, ACTION","21, 29, LOCATION"}

6073	The manuscript entitled“Daily iron supplementation with 60 mg ferrous sulfate for 12-weeks does not increase non-transferrin bound iron concentrations in Cambodian women with a high prevalence of hemoglobinopathies” presents interesting issue, but some really important corrections are needed.	{"244, 247, TRIGGER","23, 215, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION"}
6074	As Authors analysed the iron supplementation in the mixed population of anemic and non-anemic individuals/ individuals with hemoglobinopathies and without, the participants can not be treated  as a homogenic sample. Authors should treat their results as a basis for broader analysis – they should conduct statistical analysis in a sub-groups (for anemic women/ non-anemic women; those with hemoglobinopathies/ without), as without such detailed analysis, the scientific value of the presented results is very low.	{"501, 512, ACTION","305, 418, CONTENT","423, 430, TRIGGER","431, 453, CONTENT","297, 305, ACTION","290, 297, MODAL","231, 237, ACTION","224, 231, MODAL","455, 475, CONTENT","483, 500, LOCATION","173, 191, ACTION","192, 214, CONTENT","160, 172, LOCATION","237, 282, CONTENT"}

6076	It seems, that Authors are not native English speakers as some sentences are hard to follow and there is a lack of flow in the text (e.g. lines 18-20 – is 2015 the year or number of women?). The manuscript should be corrected  by native English speaker or preferably by the professional agency.	{"160, 188, CONTENT","127, 132, LOCATION","152, 154, TRIGGER","216, 227, ACTION","206, 213, MODAL","195, 205, LOCATION","138, 149, LOCATION","63, 72, CONTENT","77, 91, ACTION","107, 119, ACTION","155, 159, LOCATION"}

6085	The section is not consistent – Authors previously present the WHO recommendation and afterwards, they indicate that in their opinion the indicated recommendations have no sense (lines 47-50:“a waste of resources, and at worst, it could cause harm”). Such approach should not be presented . Authors may indicate advantages and disadvantages of recommended policy, but they should not try to discredit WHO. Moreover, Authors should have a broader international perspective and not perceive only the own point of view (Cambodian perspective), as WHO recommendations are for various countries, not only for Cambodia.	{"299, 302, MODAL","272, 288, ACTION","364, 367, TRIGGER","303, 311, ACTION","191, 248, LOCATION","544, 612, CONTENT","541, 543, TRIGGER","424, 430, MODAL","251, 264, CONTENT","312, 362, CONTENT","436, 471, CONTENT","489, 539, CONTENT","476, 488, ACTION","380, 400, ACTION","179, 190, LOCATION","406, 414, TRIGGER","401, 404, CONTENT","373, 379, MODAL","431, 435, ACTION","4, 11, LOCATION","265, 271, MODAL"}

6100	The manuscript entitled“Analysis of the effects of dietary pattern on the oral microbiome of elite endurance athletes” presents interesting issue, but some corrections are still needed, as Authors did not correct the previously indicated problems.Major problem:The major problem in the presented study is the fact that participants were assigned to a specific diet base on their own choice “according to their beliefs in the potential effect on their performance”). Authors answered this issue but they did not specify it in their manuscript. Such choice is a very important bias, as the choice is neither random nor based on any criteria. Is should be extensively described  and in my previous review, I have indicated what should be specified  in Materials and Methods section: how were the diets described to participants, was there any special presentation of diets before a choice, which features were presented, who did present diets, was there any possibility to change ones mind, etc. If Authors state that participants choose diet on their own, that must present the detailed procedure influencing  the choice.Abstract:Authors should justify their study – indicate why did they plan to conduct the study exactly in athletes on ketogenic diet (what was the need).Authors should precisely describe the obtained data with the specific results.Materials and Methods:The characteristics of diets should be presented  – the nutritional value and content of products from a specific groups – not for a specific days (as in the previously published studies) but the mean values as they are crucial to interpret the presented data. – Authors stated that it is presented in lines 86-93 but it is not. As I stated previously, Authors should present (1) nutritional value (not only macronutrients), (2) content of products from a specific groupsResults:The characteristics of the studied group should be presented  – especially ethnicity, but also other factors, e.g. gender, BMI, age, previous diet, etc. – it should be presented  as mean (BMI) or share of a group (ethnicity), not as a detailed characteristics of each participant separately and it should be transferred  from supplementary material to the main body of the study.Discussion:Authors should extensively discuss the possible reasons of their observations, while they should relate the discussion to very specific results that were observed and the fact that it was assessed exactly in athletes.Authors should extensively discuss the limitations of the study associated with the conducted study (e.g. method of diet assessment, etc.) and with the concluding (e.g. possibility to conclude on the basis of conducted research, the choice of diet by participants).Authors should formulate the conclusions from their study – real are needed – currently the only conclusion is“to further investigate”. On the basis of conclusions only, it seems that so far Authors had no observations at all.	{"503, 518, ACTION","1143, 1150, ACTION","1279, 1285, MODAL","1296, 1304, ACTION","1305, 1348, CONTENT","1349, 1370, LOCATION","1371, 1399, CONTENT","1136, 1142, MODAL","1119, 1127, LOCATION","1399, 1406, MODAL","1410, 1419, ACTION","1423, 1630, CONTENT","1072, 1118, CONTENT","1673, 1684, LOCATION","1732, 1738, MODAL","1739, 1746, ACTION","1747, 1842, CONTENT","1842, 1849, LOCATION","1850, 1890, CONTENT","1891, 1897, MODAL","1064, 1071, ACTION","1059, 1063, MODAL","1901, 1910, ACTION","1925, 1934, CONTENT","1965, 2002, CONTENT","2008, 2014, MODAL","1015, 1052, CONTENT","945, 986, CONTENT","941, 944, TRIGGER","2018, 2027, ACTION","830, 885, ACTION","2032, 2042, CONTENT","2043, 2045, TRIGGER","826, 829, TRIGGER","2046, 2074, CONTENT","922, 939, CONTENT","2076, 2079, TRIGGER","917, 921, TRIGGER","893, 916, CONTENT","2083, 2140, CONTENT","2148, 2154, MODAL","2158, 2169, ACTION","2176, 2198, LOCATION","2206, 2215, LOCATION","2229, 2239, LOCATION","2248, 2254, MODAL","887, 892, TRIGGER","2267, 2274, ACTION","784, 824, CONTENT","780, 783, TRIGGER","665, 674, ACTION","2275, 2317, CONTENT","643, 649, MODAL","319, 389, CONTENT","531, 541, LOCATION","493, 497, TRIGGER","147, 150, TRIGGER","2330, 2336, MODAL","2337, 2343, ACTION","2344, 2456, CONTENT","23, 118, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","2465, 2471, MODAL","2484, 2491, ACTION","2492, 2721, CONTENT","2730, 2736, MODAL","2737, 2746, ACTION","2747, 2779, CONTENT","1165, 1173, ACTION","1174, 1270, CONTENT","390, 463, LOCATION"}
6101	The manuscript by Ma and Liu reviews ZIF membranes for light hydrocarbon separations. The topic is of interest to both professionals and academics working in the fields of membranes, MOFs and hydrocarbon separation. The work fits well the scope of the journal. There are several articles to be incorporated into the review to make it comprehensive. The context is limited and needs to be improved. The materials perspective is good but the engineering angle is limited. The manuscript needs to be reconsidered after having addressed the comments listed below:	{"376, 381, MODAL","388, 396, ACTION","497, 509, ACTION","474, 484, LOCATION","485, 493, MODAL","4, 14, LOCATION","349, 360, CONTENT","361, 371, ACTION"}
6102	1. The review should have more critical comments, and give a fair account of both the advantages and disadvantages of the presented separations. Critical accounts should also be discussed (Current Opinion in Chemical Engineering 2011, 1, 77-83).	{"82, 143, CONTENT","54, 58, ACTION","26, 48, CONTENT","189, 243, CONTENT","7, 13, LOCATION","163, 169, MODAL","14, 20, MODAL","21, 25, ACTION","145, 162, CONTENT","178, 187, ACTION"}
6103	2. Bulk referencing should be avoided , e.g. [2-5], [14-23] etc. A review article is not the same as a compilation of literature. When multiple references are grouped together, it is difficult for the readers to digest the message and find the information they need.	{"45, 59, CONTENT","30, 37, ACTION","20, 26, MODAL","3, 19, CONTENT"}
6104	3. The authors should introduce MOF membranes from a broader perspective and mention their versatility in different separations and give examples such as oil/water separation (ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 2018, 10, 17301-17308; J. Membr. Sci., 2018, 566, 268-277), organic solvent nanofiltration (J. Mater. Chem. A, 2014, 2, 9260-9271; J. Membr. Sci., 2016, 503, 166-176), xylene isomer separation (Inorganic Chemistry Communications, 2013, 30, 74-78), switchable separations (Nature Comm. 2018, 9, 3968).	{"77, 84, ACTION","22, 31, ACTION","15, 21, MODAL","32, 45, CONTENT","85, 127, CONTENT","132, 136, ACTION","154, 504, CONTENT"}

6106	5. A novel table should be added that compares the hydrocarbon separation performance of the ZIF membranes discussed  in the review.	{"47, 106, CONTENT","17, 23, MODAL","3, 16, CONTENT","27, 32, ACTION","125, 131, LOCATION"}
6107	6.

6108	7. In the review the authors should mention the use of software-assisted experimental design of membranes and membrane systems to encourage their use, which does not require extensive theoretical knowledge of the field and can be easily employed  by industrial professionals as well; and give some recent filtration examples from the membrane literature using design of experiments (DoE) optimization approach: ACS Catal., 2018, 8, 7430-7438; J. Membr. Sci., 2015, 493, 568-579.

6110	9. The recent https://doi.org/10.1002/ange.201708924 article presents a new approach for the fabrication of ZIF membranes for propylene/propane separation, which should be mentioned  in the review.	{"3, 60, CONTENT","172, 181, ACTION","190, 196, LOCATION","72, 154, CONTENT","162, 168, MODAL"}
6111	10. The“Adsorption (2018) 24:691” article should be acknowledged , it discussed the same material and separation but from a different approach. Similarly,“Chem. Mater., 2018, 30 (2), 447-455” also discussed the same material for a novel application, which should be briefly incorporated  into the introduction about the target materials.	{"297, 309, LOCATION","274, 286, ACTION","256, 262, MODAL","154, 191, CONTENT","4, 41, CONTENT","52, 64, ACTION","42, 48, MODAL"}

6113	The main problem is associated with the fact, that Authors applied the tools, that were either not validated at all (their own questionnaire), or were validated, but in a different groups (GSRS validated for groups of IBS patients and pelvic ulcer patients). Without the validation conducted in the properly chosen group, it can not be stated , that the results obtained using the form allow to conclude. This problem is especially important, if the data obtained using the forms are the main data in the study.	{"162, 165, TRIGGER","143, 145, TRIGGER"}

In such an extensive study, the authors could have considered including  some green solvents, especially from the class of alcohols, which seem to work the best based on the results. The authors should refer to book chapter 3.15, Organic Solvents in Sustainable Synthesis and Engineering, Green Chemistry – An Inclusive Approach, 2018, 513-553 (Elsevier) as a guideline for solvent selection.	{"167, 176, ACTION","145, 155, MODAL","479, 496, CONTENT","316, 459, CONTENT","307, 312, ACTION","300, 306, MODAL","279, 286, LOCATION","3, 53, CONTENT","210, 236, CONTENT","183, 197, CONTENT","54, 60, MODAL","64, 73, ACTION","76, 80, TRIGGER","81, 103, CONTENT"}

6281	The manuscript evaluates the treatment of wastewater in China over the period 2011-2015. It uses a statistical model (Directional Distance Function) to determine the efficiency of inputs and outputs such as GDP, wastewater and expense efficiency. The study is comprehensive; drawing conclusions from data gathered over 31 different regions across China. Based on their findings, the authors give critical recommendations about actions which could be taken. The article fits well into the scope of Applied Sciences and could be further considered  for publication after major alterations.	{"4, 14, LOCATION"}
6282	1. When stating the input and output variables in Table 1, the authors should explain the parentheses/units and what these refer to (e.g. Population (10,000 persons)). These units on all efficiencies should be made clear before the explanations that follow in Section 4.2.	{"168, 199, CONTENT","260, 271, LOCATION","210, 220, ACTION","200, 206, MODAL","117, 131, CONTENT","112, 116, TRIGGER","86, 107, CONTENT","78, 85, ACTION","71, 77, MODAL","50, 57, LOCATION","138, 165, LOCATION"}
6283	2. The presentation of data tables should be made neater before publication. As some tables’ present data for 31 regions, these contain lots of information and appear cluttered. The authors could separate regions by gridlines in the tables, making it easier for the reader to visualise.	{"190, 195, MODAL","57, 75, CONTENT","196, 204, ACTION","205, 225, CONTENT","233, 239, LOCATION","23, 34, LOCATION","35, 41, MODAL","45, 49, ACTION","85, 91, LOCATION"}
6284	3. Table 8 should be restructured . It can be seen the heading Rank is sometimes spread over two rows. This appears untidy and should be corrected  prior to publication.	{"21, 33, ACTION","137, 146, ACTION","11, 17, MODAL","51, 101, CONTENT","103, 107, CONTENT","3, 10, LOCATION","127, 133, MODAL"}
6285	4. For all of the efficiency graphs (Figures 1 – 6), showing average values of various inputs and outputs, each data point should contain standard deviation (or error bars) about these mean values for each year. These would make the figures more information rich and give an idea to the reader regarding  the spread of results about the mean. It should also be stated explicitly how these errors were calculated. As the study is based on a theoretical model, the more statistical analysis that can be presented  in the figures would be beneficial to the manuscript.	{"383, 411, CONTENT","519, 526, LOCATION","501, 510, ACTION","554, 564, LOCATION","138, 210, CONTENT","130, 137, ACTION","493, 497, MODAL","123, 129, MODAL","107, 122, CONTENT","18, 35, LOCATION","37, 50, LOCATION","233, 240, LOCATION","459, 488, CONTENT","346, 352, MODAL","361, 367, ACTION","379, 382, TRIGGER"}
6286	5. In Section 4.2.2, the author(s) make statements such as: The COD of all regions are all above 0.6534. The author(s) should provide some benchmark values, putting these results into context as to what constitutes a good efficiency score. This could be done by referencing existing literature or modelling  efficiency scores over the previous 10 years in China for comparison. This would help the reader to immediately determine the performance of wastewater treatment compared to similar works.	{"119, 125, MODAL","6, 19, LOCATION","262, 273, ACTION","251, 258, ACTION","126, 133, ACTION","60, 103, LOCATION","139, 238, CONTENT","297, 306, ACTION","274, 293, CONTENT","244, 250, MODAL","308, 361, CONTENT"}

6288	7. The author(s) are inconsistent in describing the efficiencies. For example in Section 4.2.2 the author(s) state 0.6556 and 7438. The efficiencies should have a maximum value of 1 and these misquotations of results in the text should be corrected  prior to publication.	{"126, 130, LOCATION","229, 235, MODAL","156, 160, ACTION","161, 181, CONTENT","224, 228, LOCATION","81, 94, LOCATION","115, 121, LOCATION","192, 216, CONTENT","239, 248, ACTION","132, 148, CONTENT","149, 155, MODAL"}
6289	8. In Table 2, it should be made clearer how the Rate (%) is determined (bottom row). It is unclear whether this refers to the duration over which this rate is determined.

Given the global trend toward sustainable solutions, the authors should write a short paragraph in the introduction, and mention the importance and need for sustainable solutions for various applications among them water treatment, and give some diverse examples such desalination (Green Chem., 2018, 20, 3689-3695); wastewater treatment (Green Chem., 2015, 17, 5196-5205); water management (J. Clean. Product., 2018, 172, 786-794); catalysis (ACS Catal., 2018, 8, 7430-7438); extraction (J. Clean.

6292	The manuscript entitled „ Consumption of ultra-processed foods and nutritional profile in a health promotion service of Brazilian primary care” presents interesting issue, but some areas must be corrected . Unfortunately Authors still did not correct the problems which I indicated in my previous review.	{"251, 263, CONTENT","172, 175, TRIGGER","195, 204, ACTION","235, 250, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION","176, 186, CONTENT","187, 191, MODAL","24, 143, LOCATION"}

6299	The manuscript details the fabrication, characterisation and some performance tests of dopamine-based FO membranes. The work has some novelty and potential impact. The topic is of interest to a broad audience. However, whether the manuscript fits within the scope of the journal is questionable. The manuscript is well-written and organized. The following technical issues need to be addressed:	{"210, 217, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","384, 393, ACTION","342, 372, CONTENT","373, 377, MODAL"}
6300	1. Only 0.3 wt% DA was present in the membrane? The authors should also quantify the amount of the DA used during  the membrane preparation and express its incorporation into the membrane. It seems that most of the DA remains in solution and does not for part of the membrane. In this case the problem of lack of sustainability should be mentioned  in the manuscript.	{"152, 187, CONTENT","72, 80, ACTION","81, 139, CONTENT","338, 347, ACTION","3, 46, CONTENT","290, 327, CONTENT","328, 334, MODAL","60, 66, MODAL","356, 366, LOCATION","144, 151, ACTION"}
6301	2. The experimental description for the TFC membrane (section 2.3) is not clearly explained. A table should be included  with all the components and relevant information for each membrane. The wt% does not add up to 100.	{"193, 196, LOCATION","126, 187, CONTENT","54, 65, LOCATION","197, 212, ACTION","70, 91, ACTION","213, 219, CONTENT","3, 52, CONTENT","101, 107, MODAL","93, 100, CONTENT","111, 119, ACTION"}

6303	4. The figures are very difficult to see and some of the text, especially the legend is not legible at all; they should all be enlarged.	{"7, 14, LOCATION","127, 135, ACTION","113, 119, MODAL","108, 112, CONTENT","88, 99, ACTION","78, 84, LOCATION","57, 61, LOCATION","19, 40, ACTION"}

6307	8. The error bars are standard deviations? Based on how many measurements? Were independently prepared membranes used? These should be clarified  in the manuscript.	{"3, 41, CONTENT","75, 79, TRIGGER","80, 117, CONTENT","125, 131, MODAL","153, 163, LOCATION","135, 144, ACTION","43, 73, CONTENT","119, 124, CONTENT"}
6308	The manuscript by Terraza et al. describes the effect of nanoparticles on PVDF-based mixed matrix membranes. The manuscript is well written, it has a good amount of data presented, and it is of interest to a broad audience working as materials scientists, polymer chemists or chemical engineers. The discussions and the data are of good quality. The work is novel and has a potential to be published in polymers subject to addressing the following concerns:	{"320, 324, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","423, 433, ACTION","434, 456, CONTENT","113, 123, LOCATION","300, 311, LOCATION"}
6309	1. The panels in Figure 1 need to be labelled“a” to“d” and the figure caption needs to describe each panel for better understanding of the procedure.	{"45, 54, CONTENT","63, 77, LOCATION","37, 45, ACTION","7, 25, LOCATION","96, 106, LOCATION","78, 83, MODAL","87, 95, ACTION","26, 30, MODAL"}
6310	2. The MMM preparation is somewhat unclear. The 2-10 wt.% refers to the solid content of the final membrane, or the entire dope solution comprising of the polymer, NP and solvent? The composition should be clarified  in the text (line 134).	{"58, 107, CONTENT","196, 202, MODAL","112, 178, CONTENT","180, 195, CONTENT","224, 228, LOCATION","109, 111, TRIGGER","206, 215, ACTION","35, 42, ACTION","48, 57, LOCATION","3, 22, CONTENT","230, 238, LOCATION"}
6311	3. A more elaborate explanation should be provided on the observation that the NPs are preferably located  in the bulk and not the surface (paragraph 231). Is there a sufficient adhesion of the NPs to the polymer matrix? Are the NPs breaking off the surface? These problems often seen for MMMs when rigid fillers are used. A crosslinking solution has been proposed to achieve robust MMMs, which should be mentioned  by the authors (ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 2018, 10, 16140-16147).	{"75, 138, CONTENT","140, 153, LOCATION","156, 158, TRIGGER","165, 219, CONTENT","221, 224, TRIGGER","225, 257, CONTENT","323, 387, CONTENT","395, 401, MODAL","432, 482, CONTENT","3, 31, CONTENT","405, 414, ACTION","32, 38, MODAL","42, 50, ACTION"}
6312	4. The molecular weight of the PVDF purchased should be mentioned  under section 2. The purity/grade of the chemicals should also be included under the materials part of the manuscript.	{"3, 45, CONTENT","133, 141, ACTION","174, 184, LOCATION","118, 124, MODAL","84, 117, CONTENT","73, 82, LOCATION","152, 161, LOCATION","46, 52, MODAL","56, 65, ACTION"}

6318	10. A similar membrane distillation approach of MMM using PVDF but not with Cu-NPs but GO was reported in the literature, which also focus on the effect of the filler, and therefore should be acknowledged  in the introduction around line 93 (J. Membr. Sci., 2018, 554, 309-323).	{"87, 89, CONTENT","242, 276, CONTENT","233, 240, LOCATION","213, 225, LOCATION","192, 204, ACTION","182, 188, MODAL","83, 86, TRIGGER"}
6319	11. The authors could consider doing  EDX to map the Cu content in the membrane.	{"16, 21, MODAL","38, 79, CONTENT","22, 36, ACTION"}
6320	13. The conclusion section is weak and does not provide a sufficient discussion on the main conclusions. Elaborate more and add some quantitative statements regarding the main research outcomes. The limitations and drawbacks of the approach as well as future directions (e.g. test the membranes in membrane distillation?) should be briefly mentioned .	{"128, 193, CONTENT","195, 321, CONTENT","340, 349, ACTION","8, 26, LOCATION","27, 34, ACTION","322, 328, MODAL","39, 55, ACTION","56, 103, CONTENT","124, 127, ACTION","115, 119, CONTENT","105, 114, ACTION"}
6321	The manuscript entitled“The Role of Foods as Dietary Sources of Vitamin D for Ethnic Minority Populations: The Underestimated Challenge” presents interesting issue, but some really major  corrections are needed.	{"4, 14, LOCATION","169, 199, CONTENT","165, 168, TRIGGER","204, 210, ACTION","23, 136, LOCATION"}
6322	(1)    Major problem associated with applied definitions and improperly formulated title/ aim of the study:	{"83, 88, LOCATION","90, 106, LOCATION"}
6323	Authors improperly formulated the title and the aim, while compared with the main body of the study, as there seem to be a misunderstanding of some definitions. Authors use the terms such as“ethnic populations”/“ethnic minority”, while they state that there is a problem“due to the skin pigment melanin and/or reduced skin exposure due to coverage required by religious and cultural restrictions”. But the definition of“ethnic populations”/“ethnic minority” is different and incomparable with those applied by Authors. The“ethnic group” is defined as a group of people with the common nation, ancestry, history, language, culture, society, while“ethnic minority” is defined as a group of people with common nation, ancestry, etc., that is different from the majority of population.	{"522, 536, LOCATION","398, 401, TRIGGER","270, 396, LOCATION","645, 662, LOCATION","211, 228, LOCATION","190, 210, LOCATION","77, 86, LOCATION","48, 51, LOCATION","34, 39, LOCATION","8, 29, ACTION","440, 457, LOCATION","419, 439, LOCATION"}
6324	So, Authors must understand, that“skin pigment melanin and/or reduced skin exposure due to coverage required by religious and cultural restrictions” is typical for only SOME of minorities – e.g. Malaysian minority in Great Britain. But for the British minority in Malaysia, there is totally different problem (e.g. resulting from lack of traditional British products being sources of vitamin D).	{"232, 235, TRIGGER","33, 148, LOCATION","12, 16, MODAL","17, 27, ACTION"}
6325	It seems, that Authors aimed to assess the minorities in western countries, but is also not so simple, as for French minority in Great Britain the indicated problems also do not exist. So maybe Authors wanted to assess just Middle East, Asian and African minorities? If so, there is not adequate information in the study.	{"280, 286, ACTION","209, 265, CONTENT","315, 320, LOCATION","287, 307, CONTENT"}
6326	Authors must verify their approach and reformulate their thesis in order to be in agreement with the general definitions. Lack of a broader international perspective and perceiving only the own point of view seem as a lack of political correctness. It should be re-analyzed not only due to communicativeness of the study, but also due to presenting improper beliefs and opinions (western people are ALSO minorities if changing the country).	{"51, 63, CONTENT","249, 251, CONTENT","252, 258, MODAL","262, 273, ACTION","13, 19, ACTION","20, 34, CONTENT","39, 50, ACTION","8, 12, MODAL"}
6327	The serious flaw of the presented manuscript is associated with the fact, that it presents a highly subjective review, not a systematic review. While the systematic review has a key role for broadening knowledge, the other reviews don’t have such role.	{"34, 44, LOCATION","4, 16, ACTION"}
6328	Taking into account, that the Materials and methods section is not presented, without any specific information, it is hard to understand which studies were included into review and why. Authors did not present any key words, which were used during literature search, inclusion and exclusion criteria of references, information about the procedure of literature search conducted by them, number of chosen references, as well as information if some of them were excluded from the review and on the basis of which criteria.	{"211, 519, CONTENT","194, 209, ACTION","60, 76, ACTION","30, 59, LOCATION"}
6329	The manuscript should be prepared  according to the instructions for authors (e.g., running title under title is not needed)	{"110, 123, ACTION","15, 21, MODAL","84, 97, CONTENT","48, 76, CONTENT","4, 14, LOCATION","25, 33, ACTION","104, 109, LOCATION"}
6330	Authors in their abstract justified their study, but they did not present any other information. On the basis of the Abstract, the readers must get familiar with the aim of the study, the methodology (in the case of review articles also), main observations and conclusions – it must be presented .	{"278, 282, MODAL","17, 25, LOCATION","162, 272, CONTENT","286, 295, ACTION","117, 125, LOCATION","49, 52, TRIGGER"}
6331	Lines 28-40 – Authors should not present basic or even trivial information about vitamin D, that are well known for the readers of Nutrients journal (e.g.“Humans can obtain vitamin D both from ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation”).	{"154, 225, LOCATION","41, 111, CONTENT","22, 32, MODAL","33, 40, ACTION","0, 11, LOCATION"}

6333	Lines 50-51 – Authors improperly present the sources of vitamin D – Authors should analyze the typical serving  size and the content (e.g. not all the fishes can be perceived  as a source of vitamin D, while the content in yolk is really low in comparison with some species).	{"22, 40, ACTION","91, 274, CONTENT","83, 90, ACTION","0, 11, LOCATION","76, 82, MODAL","41, 65, CONTENT"}
6334	The section should be presented  (see above).	{"22, 31, ACTION","12, 18, MODAL","4, 11, LOCATION"}
6335	Lines 56-71 – should be removed , as not associated with the aim of the study – it seems that Authors included this paragraph in order to refer the own study [17] not associated with the aim of the study	{"111, 125, LOCATION","24, 31, ACTION","14, 20, MODAL","0, 11, LOCATION","158, 162, LOCATION"}
6336	Liners 210-242 – should be removed , as not associated with the aim of the study – it is only weakly associated with the problem of minorities and is rather general than specific – it seems that Authors included this paragraph in order to refer the own study [49] not associated with the aim of the study	{"27, 34, ACTION","17, 23, MODAL","0, 14, LOCATION","259, 263, LOCATION","212, 226, LOCATION"}
6337	Tables – are the strongest part of the study – may be interesting  and comprehensive, but conducting a systematic review and specifying what do Authors mean by“minorities” is essential	{"159, 171, LOCATION","0, 6, LOCATION","90, 100, ACTION","86, 89, TRIGGER","125, 135, ACTION"}

6339	The formulated conclusions should be directly associated with the conducted  analysis of literature, while Authors should indicate any novelty, with no truisms “Dietary pattern is known to vary between ethnic populations”).	{"46, 56, ACTION","135, 142, CONTENT","160, 221, LOCATION","62, 99, CONTENT","0, 26, CONTENT","115, 121, MODAL","122, 130, ACTION","27, 33, MODAL"}
6340	The manuscript entitled“The comparative validity and reliability of a non-nutritive sweetener food frequency questionnaire” presents an interesting issue, and in my opinion it is worth to be published, but only after corrections, that are needed.	{"202, 205, TRIGGER","23, 123, LOCATION","239, 245, ACTION","217, 228, CONTENT","4, 14, LOCATION"}
6341	(1)    While Authors assess the repeated measurements conducted using the same tool, they use the“reliability” term, while“reproducibility” would be better (or“repeatability”) – it should be corrected  for better communicativeness.	{"159, 174, CONTENT","146, 155, ACTION","140, 145, MODAL","191, 200, ACTION","122, 139, CONTENT","181, 187, MODAL","97, 110, LOCATION"}
6342	(2)    Neither assessment of the difference between results, nor the analysis of correlation is the most recommended method in the validation of the FFQ. The Bland-Altman method is indicated as a“gold standard”, while kappa statistic is indicated as other good method [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19079912], and correlation may be used  only in conjunction with other method. It should be reflected  in the Results and Discussion, as Authors present rather other methods than those most prominent (especially 3.3. section).	{"427, 437, LOCATION","387, 393, MODAL","397, 406, ACTION","154, 382, CONTENT","517, 529, LOCATION","415, 422, LOCATION"}

6377	In this article, the authors investigated the reaction of hydrogen sulphide on Pd membranes, and its influence on hydrogen permeability. A redox methodology was also proposed for the removal of hydrogen sulphide to restore Pd activity. While results showed that the sulphides could be completely removed , due to the lack of real-case experiments (i.e., the change in hydrogen selectivity was not studied), and some false assumptions the manuscript needs to be seriously revised prior to further consideration. Consequently, I recommend major revision. My detailed comments are below:	{"438, 448, LOCATION","3, 15, LOCATION","471, 478, ACTION","448, 454, MODAL"}
6378	1)      The authors should avoid bulk referencing . If possible, a review should be provided  instead of referring to 4-7 different papers at the same time.	{"105, 155, CONTENT","93, 104, TRIGGER","84, 92, ACTION","20, 27, MODAL","27, 32, ACTION","32, 49, CONTENT","74, 80, MODAL","67, 73, CONTENT"}
6379	2)      Throughout the manuscript many words that should be separated  were written together, i.e. obtainedare (row 44), a lsoincreased (row 88), theworking (row 121), couldnot (row 202), etc. The authors should review the manuscript and correct every typo.	{"178, 185, LOCATION","246, 256, CONTENT","23, 33, LOCATION","99, 110, LOCATION","212, 218, ACTION","33, 44, CONTENT","50, 56, MODAL","111, 120, LOCATION","137, 143, LOCATION","158, 165, LOCATION","60, 69, ACTION","123, 135, LOCATION","205, 212, MODAL","146, 156, LOCATION","168, 176, LOCATION","223, 233, LOCATION","238, 245, ACTION"}
6380	3)      A Material section should be included where every membrane and chemical used , listed with supplier and purity if applicable.	{"26, 33, MODAL","10, 26, LOCATION","46, 132, CONTENT","37, 45, ACTION"}
6381	4)      The experimental section should be elaborated . There should be different sections for the pre-treatment of membrane, H2S reaction with Pd, Removal of H2S. The applied conditions (temperature, pressure, time) should be also provided .	{"62, 68, MODAL","72, 162, CONTENT","69, 71, ACTION","12, 32, LOCATION","43, 53, ACTION","32, 40, MODAL","164, 217, CONTENT","217, 223, MODAL","231, 241, ACTION"}

6383	6)      In the experimental section Ar was also listed under the gases that were used. However, in the manuscript the use of Ar was not mentioned.	{"15, 35, LOCATION","114, 128, CONTENT","103, 113, LOCATION","128, 145, ACTION","87, 96, TRIGGER"}
6384	7)      What was the rationale behind choosing the oxidation (500 °C) and reduction temperature and time (23 °C, 5 min)? The authors should optimise the reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, time) for the oxidation and reduction experiment. In case these reaction conditions were chosen based on a previous paper, at least a reference should be provided .	{"351, 359, ACTION","133, 139, MODAL","139, 148, ACTION","148, 246, CONTENT","8, 12, TRIGGER","13, 119, CONTENT","329, 340, CONTENT","341, 347, MODAL"}

6386	9)      The authors should write a short paragraph / few sentences on the importance of hydrogen separation and the trend towards sustainable membrane materials and membrane processes, and examples should be provided : International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 2017, 42, 13763-13776; Green Chemistry, 2017, 19, 3116-3125; Applied Science, 2017, 7, 1026.	{"189, 197, CONTENT","33, 183, CONTENT","219, 353, CONTENT","208, 216, ACTION","197, 204, MODAL","27, 32, ACTION","20, 26, MODAL"}

6388	11)   The first two sentences on page 4 (row 103–106) is not understandable. The authors should rephrase them.	{"10, 39, LOCATION","41, 52, LOCATION","96, 104, ACTION","54, 75, ACTION","89, 95, MODAL"}
6389	12)   “where almost 100nm granulate products were produced” (row 109) -> How was the thickness calculated?

6390	13)    “and latticed products were produced in the crystal boundary location in Fig. 3 ( b ) at 350 °C.” -> Fig. 3 (b) presents a surface that was treated at 250 °C. The authors should revise the sentence accordingly.	{"7, 104, LOCATION","107, 118, LOCATION","178, 184, MODAL","185, 192, ACTION","192, 204, CONTENT"}
6391	14)    “…indicating Pd4S appeared and accumulated…” -> According to the XRD results (comparing Fig 1 (c) and Fig 1 (d) ), with increasing temperature more Pd16S7 formed and the amount of Pd4S did not increase significantly. Therefore, the sentence should be “…indicating that Pd16S7 appeared and accumulated…”	{"224, 234, TRIGGER","235, 247, CONTENT","94, 105, LOCATION","109, 118, LOCATION","248, 254, MODAL","258, 309, CONTENT","7, 51, LOCATION"}
6392	15)   “the originally prominent latticed PdS disappeared” -> Previously it was stated that the latticed structure is caused by Pd4S (Pd16S7?) row 114–115. The authors should re-evaluate the XRD and SEM results and revise the sentence.	{"221, 234, CONTENT","141, 155, LOCATION","6, 57, LOCATION","167, 173, MODAL","173, 185, ACTION","185, 209, CONTENT","213, 221, ACTION"}

6395	18)   The calculations of dP/dt (equation 2) and flux (equation 5) should be removed .

6397	20)   “so that there were more active sites to dissolve hydrogen and adsorb more hydrogen molecules on Pdmembrane surface” -> While this statement might be true, it should not be neglected  that after the H2S, redox treatment, a porous Pd is formed. Therefore, in this case the mechanism of H2 permeability might not be solution-diffusion anymore. The increased permeability could be a result of transport through the pores.	{"6, 122, LOCATION","179, 189, ACTION","249, 261, TRIGGER","195, 248, CONTENT","165, 175, MODAL"}

6399	It seems that there is a serious ethical problem associated with guest authorship procedure which is forbidden. The manuscript is indicated as authored by 24 Authors, while in fact it presents only a data from a relatively small sample of individuals (34 CRC patients and 32 controls). At the same time, based on the information indicated in Authors Contributions Section, some Authors did not contribute manuscript at all, as they only participated in e.g. recruitment of participants (based on the presented information, recruitment was conducted by 4 persons and some of them did nothing more but only participated in recruitment).

6401	Authors stated that they conducted in their study in “34 CRC patients and 32 matched healthy donors”, but it seems that they were in fact not properly matched, as no pair-matching was applied. Authors should have a equal number of CRC and control individuals, as for each patient they should have control individual, as without it matching does not increase the value of presented analysis.	{"208, 213, ACTION","53, 100, LOCATION","263, 279, CONTENT","200, 207, MODAL","285, 291, MODAL","291, 296, ACTION","213, 258, CONTENT","297, 315, CONTENT","102, 105, TRIGGER"}

6456	This section should be precisely associated  with actual results – e.g. if Authors assessed declaration (self-reporting) they should all the time discuss the assessed features as self-reported. In fact, the features were not assessed but only the declaration of features was assessed.

6461	The manuscript by Liu and co-workers is of interest to a broader scientific and professional community but the manuscript need to be significantly improved prior to acceptance for publication. The work is detailed enough to ensure understanding, the majority of the manuscript reads well and built in a logical manner. However, some technical and presentation issues need to be addressed, and the introduction is too narrow and a broader context needs to be given.	{"446, 451, MODAL","147, 155, ACTION","102, 106, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","410, 423, ACTION","266, 276, LOCATION","378, 387, ACTION","328, 367, CONTENT","367, 371, MODAL","122, 127, MODAL","458, 463, ACTION","111, 121, LOCATION","319, 326, TRIGGER","397, 409, LOCATION","428, 445, CONTENT"}
6463	2. The figure captions need to be more informative. Elaborate in a line or two on each figure so that they stand on their own. This will facilitate understanding  of the work.	{"65, 125, CONTENT","28, 50, ACTION","7, 22, LOCATION","22, 27, MODAL","52, 61, ACTION"}
6464	3. The following articles on the sustainability of agriculture in China should be incorporated  into the discussions: Sustainability 2018, 10, 1776; World Development, 1992, 20, 1127-1144.	{"105, 116, LOCATION","82, 94, ACTION","72, 79, MODAL","3, 71, CONTENT","118, 187, CONTENT"}

6469	8. Before the final paragraph in the Introduction, the authors should add a short, second-to-last paragraph on sustainability from a general perspective. Mention that attempts toward sustainable production is emerging in various fields such as agriculture (Green Chem., 2017, 19, 3116-3125.), microbiology (Microb. Biotechnol., 2017, 10, 1066-1069.), pharmaceuticals (ChemSusChem, 2017, 10, 3435-3444.), biotechnology (Microb. Biotechnol., 2017, 10, 1171-1180), catalysis (ACS Catal., 2018, 8, 7430-7438.), materials (ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 2017, 9, 11279-11289.), food and gastronomy (Sustainability 2017, 9, 1748). The diverse examples will help to broaden the context of the work and place it in a more general view on the topic of global sustainability.	{"3, 49, LOCATION","162, 622, CONTENT","154, 161, ACTION","653, 762, CONTENT","649, 653, ACTION","644, 648, MODAL","69, 73, ACTION","73, 152, CONTENT","623, 643, CONTENT","62, 69, MODAL"}
6470	9. The definitions under Table 1 should not be part of the table. Detach them and discuss them as part of the main text referring to the lines in Table 1.	{"19, 32, LOCATION","146, 153, LOCATION","47, 51, ACTION","33, 43, MODAL","73, 78, CONTENT","110, 119, LOCATION","81, 89, ACTION","66, 72, ACTION","59, 64, LOCATION","3, 19, CONTENT"}
6473	12. The Conclusions section needs to be more critical and include more detailed research needs and directions based on the findings presented in the manuscript. Moreover, the main research findings should be quantitatively summarized  in this section.	{"66, 131, CONTENT","27, 33, MODAL","57, 65, ACTION","37, 53, ACTION","8, 27, LOCATION","238, 250, LOCATION","161, 170, TRIGGER","172, 197, CONTENT","197, 204, MODAL","223, 233, ACTION","149, 159, LOCATION"}
6474	The manuscript entitled “Dietary supplements among professional athletes: food neophobia and marketing strategies to promote edible insects” presents interesting and original issue, being within the scope of the journal. The presented results may be of a significant importance for both researchers and practitioners, but a number of important corrections are necessary.	{"356, 370, ACTION","318, 321, TRIGGER","322, 355, CONTENT","24, 140, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION"}
6476	In general, in the case of studies involving human subjects (also for the retrospective analysis), the agreement of the ethical committee is compulsory – as it is defined: ‘No one should participate in research unless independent review concludes that the risks are reasonable in relation to the potential benefits.’ (National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) - https://bioethicsarchive.georgetown.edu/nbac/human/oversumm.html).	{"15, 137, CONTENT","138, 151, ACTION","173, 432, CONTENT"}
6477	Moreover, it is recommended, that the study should not be published  if it involves human subjects, but there is no relevant agreement of the ethical committee.	{"34, 43, CONTENT","58, 68, ACTION","0, 8, TRIGGER","44, 54, MODAL","69, 98, CONTENT","100, 103, TRIGGER"}
6478	So in such case, Authors should precisely indicate the agreement – they can obtain it in any local ethical committee in Italy, or obtain an official exemption from ethical committee (official statement from their local ethical committee with its reference number, that their study may be conducted / published with no ethical committee agreement).	{"136, 347, CONTENT","42, 50, ACTION","129, 136, ACTION","25, 32, MODAL","72, 75, MODAL","76, 82, ACTION","83, 125, CONTENT","50, 64, CONTENT"}
6479	Authors should specify the aim of their study (e.g. “The aim of the study was…”) instead of presenting only what was done.	{"81, 91, TRIGGER","23, 80, CONTENT","92, 121, CONTENT","7, 14, MODAL","15, 23, ACTION"}
6480	The Abstract section should present specific data associated with the studied group – “athletes” – what discipline? What gender? What age? how were they recruited?, etc.	{"4, 20, LOCATION","36, 83, CONTENT","129, 134, TRIGGER","86, 96, LOCATION","28, 35, ACTION","143, 162, CONTENT","134, 137, CONTENT","116, 120, TRIGGER","121, 127, CONTENT","104, 114, CONTENT","98, 103, TRIGGER","21, 27, MODAL","139, 142, TRIGGER"}
6481	The Abstract section should present specific results – with specific values and p-Values for statistical analysis.	{"20, 27, MODAL","27, 36, ACTION","4, 20, LOCATION","36, 113, CONTENT"}
6482	Authors should try to formulate 1 main and interesting conclusion, that would be of a value also for readers and would be associated  with aim (so far, there is no aim presented here).	{"22, 32, ACTION","8, 14, MODAL","32, 184, CONTENT"}
6483	This section is very, very, very long. Instead of 3.5 pages of various information, Authors should focus on the most important (0.5-1 page is enough for this section). But they should properly justify the study, while presenting briefly what is known and what data are necessary for broadening our general knowledge. The suggested issue that should be mentioned here is adult food neophobia, and its consequences, especially in athletes.	{"352, 361, ACTION","192, 200, ACTION","13, 37, ACTION","370, 436, CONTENT","92, 98, MODAL","99, 104, ACTION","108, 126, CONTENT","128, 138, CONTENT","342, 348, MODAL","153, 165, LOCATION","168, 171, TRIGGER","317, 336, CONTENT","200, 210, CONTENT","218, 315, CONTENT","177, 184, MODAL","0, 12, LOCATION","39, 49, TRIGGER"}
6484	In this section Authors should avoid excessive references (e.g. line 219), as this section in not the literature presentation, but rather it requires brief presentation of applied methodology.	{"23, 30, MODAL","127, 131, TRIGGER","3, 15, LOCATION","64, 72, LOCATION","78, 90, LOCATION","37, 57, CONTENT","30, 37, ACTION"}
6485	“Athletes” should be properly defined  – what was their discipline?	{"41, 66, CONTENT","0, 10, LOCATION","30, 37, ACTION","11, 17, MODAL"}
6486	In this section Authors should present the information that participants were presented with the photo of assessed bar (as stated “brief informative text on the environmental and nutritional benefits of the feeding based on insects, as well as the role that athletes can have in promoting  healthy foods”), as they may have influenced the obtained results. This information may be presented  as a supplementary file, but it should be in details presented  (specific sentences translated into English)	{"417, 420, TRIGGER","24, 30, MODAL","38, 306, CONTENT","3, 15, LOCATION","31, 38, ACTION","397, 415, LOCATION","424, 430, MODAL","373, 377, MODAL","444, 454, ACTION","381, 390, ACTION","356, 373, CONTENT"}
6487	Instead of figures, Authors should present their results as tables, as they are extremely hard to follow	{"28, 34, MODAL","34, 42, ACTION","11, 18, LOCATION","0, 10, TRIGGER","43, 66, CONTENT"}
6488	Authors presented here a number of irrelevant data (e.g. information about used supplements), that are not associated with the experiment at all.	{"99, 117, ACTION","23, 92, CONTENT"}
6489	As indicated above, Authors should rather focus on novelty of their study. Analyzing only results obtained for an insect bar as dependent from FNS results may be interesting enough to be published , but only if properly analyzed.	{"27, 34, MODAL","48, 74, CONTENT","41, 47, ACTION"}
6490	Tables – should be self-explanatory (be understandable with all abbreviations defined under and proper titles)	{"0, 6, LOCATION","8, 15, MODAL","35, 110, CONTENT","16, 35, ACTION"}
6491	This section should corrected accordingly and Authors should discuss only the most important results (issues of food neophobia in adults, that was verified in their insect bar choice experiment).	{"68, 195, CONTENT","60, 68, ACTION","54, 60, MODAL","19, 30, ACTION","13, 19, MODAL","0, 13, LOCATION"}
6492	Authors should present excessive limitations of their study.	{"8, 14, MODAL","22, 59, CONTENT","14, 22, ACTION"}
6493	Authors should briefly present the main conclusions from their study (associated with the specific aim).	{"31, 106, CONTENT","8, 14, MODAL","23, 30, ACTION"}
6494	Authors who did not participate in the manuscript preparing but had other role (BDD, LM) should be removed  from the Study Authors, due to the risk of guest authorship procedure that is forbidden and they should be rather presented  in Acknowledgements Section. Only Authors who actively participated in manuscript preparation should be presented  as authors of the study, while Authors may thank other persons who contributed in Acknowledgements Section.	{"430, 454, LOCATION","183, 195, ACTION","326, 333, MODAL","222, 231, ACTION","0, 89, CONTENT","89, 96, MODAL","261, 300, CONTENT","204, 212, MODAL","236, 260, LOCATION","99, 106, ACTION","151, 167, CONTENT","336, 346, ACTION","214, 221, TRIGGER"}
6495	The manuscript by Zhu and Li investigates a coagulation process for water treatment. The topic is of interest to both professionals and academics working in the fields of filtration, water treatment and optimization. The work fits well the scope of the journal, however the novelty needs to be clarified, the context needs to be broadened and some technical aspects need to be improved. There are several issues that must be addressed  prior to further consideration by Processes. The manuscript needs to be reconsidered after having carefully addressed the comments listed below:	{"4, 14, LOCATION","387, 411, CONTENT","270, 281, CONTENT","342, 365, CONTENT","417, 421, MODAL","262, 270, TRIGGER","294, 303, ACTION","305, 316, CONTENT","424, 434, ACTION","329, 338, ACTION","366, 371, MODAL","376, 385, ACTION","317, 322, MODAL","281, 287, MODAL"}
6496	1. What is the novelty of the work in relation to the state-of-the-art literature and industrial practices?

Derivation of errors should be explained  in the text.	{"129, 135, MODAL","108, 128, CONTENT","50, 62, ACTION","139, 148, ACTION","75, 79, MODAL","86, 91, ACTION","39, 43, MODAL","64, 74, CONTENT","157, 161, LOCATION","99, 106, LOCATION","4, 38, CONTENT"}
6511	16. The results section has an extensive amount of references. After each result a reference is given. This is confusing and implies that all the observations were already made in the literature, which leads to the conclusion that the manuscript lacks novelty. The authors should explicitly mention what new observation were made by the authors and supported by new data presented in the submitted manuscript.	{"273, 279, MODAL","298, 370, CONTENT","291, 298, ACTION","398, 408, LOCATION","8, 23, LOCATION"}

6513	18. Thee-panel figures should be presented  in a single row.	{"23, 30, MODAL","3, 23, LOCATION","33, 42, ACTION","44, 59, CONTENT"}
6514	19. Some of the discussions are vague and does not suffice for a scientific / engineering research article. Refrain from vague and inconclusive statements and comments, e.g.“increased almost linearly”.	{"4, 27, CONTENT","108, 115, ACTION","173, 200, LOCATION","116, 167, CONTENT","28, 37, ACTION"}
6515	20. The main quantitative results should be mentioned  in the conclusions section. The first paragraph of the conclusions section has no information content, it is too vague. Either delete it or rewrite it to be more specific. The 2nd paragraph contains information that is already known in the literature. What is the novelty and potential impact of the work presented in the manuscript?	{"161, 173, ACTION","227, 244, LOCATION","203, 227, CONTENT","182, 188, ACTION","44, 53, ACTION","194, 202, ACTION","312, 359, CONTENT","307, 311, TRIGGER","377, 387, LOCATION","87, 129, LOCATION","62, 81, LOCATION","4, 33, CONTENT","34, 40, MODAL"}
6516	The manuscript by Petrella and co-workers discusses the use of perlite for lead sorption and subsequent preparation of cement/perlite composites. The work is new and of interest to the readers of Applied Science. However, there are several technical and other issues to be addressed before further consideration to be published in the journal.	{"221, 267, CONTENT","4, 14, LOCATION","273, 282, ACTION","212, 221, TRIGGER"}
6517	1. How does the perlite composition and morphology affect the sorption results and the final composite material? The authors should comment on the robustness and general applicability of their results.	{"140, 203, CONTENT","7, 111, CONTENT","131, 139, ACTION","3, 6, TRIGGER","125, 131, MODAL"}
6518	2. The properties of the perlite are given in lines 68-72, however the sentence introduces these with a“may be” which is unusual. Were the reported values measured or taken from the literature? The authors should characterize their own adsorbent. Nonetheless, the results should be reported  in the results section and not the experimental section.	{"130, 134, TRIGGER","299, 314, LOCATION","135, 192, CONTENT","206, 213, MODAL","272, 278, MODAL","258, 271, CONTENT","225, 245, CONTENT","213, 225, ACTION","282, 290, ACTION","58, 66, TRIGGER","327, 347, LOCATION","319, 322, TRIGGER","46, 57, LOCATION"}
6519	3. The introduction of the different chemicals and materials used in the study are scattered in the manuscript. These should be all gathered  at the beginning of the experimental section. All the purity / grade and supplier should be mentioned  at this stage.	{"79, 92, ACTION","125, 127, ACTION","2, 78, CONTENT","141, 188, LOCATION","188, 224, CONTENT","118, 124, MODAL","234, 243, ACTION","224, 231, MODAL","92, 110, LOCATION"}
6520	4. What is the reported typical concentration for lead in industrial wastewater that the authors proposed to treat? How does the concentration of the ion sorption experiments compare to the industrial practice? In other words, did the authors test relevant concentrations?	{"120, 209, CONTENT","115, 120, TRIGGER","2, 7, TRIGGER","8, 114, CONTENT","227, 271, CONTENT"}
6521	5. Avoid using x/y format for the references and use the IUPAC-recommended x y^-1 throughout the manuscript.	{"2, 9, ACTION","97, 107, LOCATION","53, 81, CONTENT","49, 52, ACTION","9, 44, CONTENT"}
6522	6. Avoid vague and informal expressions such as“huge” and“remarkable”.	{"9, 69, CONTENT","3, 8, ACTION"}
6523	7. The authors should comment on the reproducibility of the results. Where possible error bars / standard deviations should be given for the breakthrough curves and sorption experiments.	{"126, 132, ACTION","75, 116, CONTENT","15, 21, MODAL","22, 30, ACTION","116, 124, MODAL","133, 186, CONTENT","30, 68, CONTENT"}
6524	8. Half of the introduction describes what the authors did instead of providing a context and background to the research area. Elaborate on wastewater treatment and current challenges. Mention the use of perlite for wastewater treatment: J. Environ. Chem. Eng., 2018, 6, 451-458.	{"193, 278, CONTENT","140, 183, CONTENT","127, 137, ACTION","184, 192, ACTION","15, 27, LOCATION"}
6525	9. The use of perlite for wastewater treatment can be considered  a sustainable solution, which should be stressed  by the authors, and the importance of / trend toward sustainable water treatment should be exemplified  in the introduction: Green Chem., 2015, 17, 5196-5205; RSC Adv., 2016, 6, 45041-45048).	{"136, 196, CONTENT","96, 102, MODAL","3, 47, CONTENT","196, 204, MODAL","227, 239, LOCATION","241, 306, CONTENT","207, 218, ACTION","106, 114, ACTION"}

6527	11. The conclusions section should summarize the main research findings in a quantitative manner. The impact of the work should be emphasized . Possible leaching of lead from the composite material should be mentioned .	{"45, 96, CONTENT","131, 141, ACTION","207, 217, ACTION","98, 120, CONTENT","8, 27, LOCATION","34, 44, ACTION","197, 204, MODAL","143, 197, CONTENT","120, 127, MODAL","28, 34, MODAL"}
6528	The manuscript entitled“The Fast Cooking and Enhanced Iron Bioavailability Properties of the Manteca Yellow Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)” presents interesting issue but some major corrections are needed.	{"23, 137, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","196, 202, ACTION","164, 169, TRIGGER","169, 191, CONTENT"}
6529	Careful editing is needed (e.g. doubled spaces after each sentence)	{"26, 67, CONTENT","0, 15, CONTENT","19, 25, ACTION"}
6530	Instead of ”food” (e.g. line 12, 33), Authors should use the phrase“food product”	{"0, 10, TRIGGER","24, 35, LOCATION","45, 52, MODAL","11, 17, LOCATION","53, 56, ACTION","56, 83, CONTENT"}
6531	Authors tend to indicate multiple references for each presented information and as a result, they included an excessive number of references (77 for the whole study, while for the Introduction only – there is 34 of them!) – the number of references should be reduced , while Authors should try to reduce the number of their own references, as they included references for 11 own studies – such excessive self-referring should be reduced .	{"389, 418, CONTENT","429, 436, ACTION","259, 266, ACTION","269, 275, TRIGGER","283, 289, MODAL","418, 425, MODAL","248, 255, MODAL","304, 386, CONTENT","297, 303, ACTION","224, 248, CONTENT"}

6534	Authors should precisely indicate the aim of the study – not the aim of YBP (lines 17-19), or indicate, that they presented all the results of YBP	{"91, 93, TRIGGER","94, 102, ACTION","34, 75, CONTENT","7, 14, MODAL","104, 146, CONTENT","75, 89, LOCATION","24, 33, ACTION"}
6535	Lines 22-23 –“nutritional evaluation” should be specified	{"48, 57, ACTION","13, 37, LOCATION","38, 44, MODAL","0, 11, LOCATION"}
6536	Authors should present only the most important information to justify their study – number of information presented should be reduced  and Authors should especially reduce the number of information that are irrelevant for the iron bioavailability and beans intake.	{"83, 116, CONTENT","172, 264, CONTENT","165, 171, ACTION","8, 15, MODAL","116, 123, MODAL","15, 23, ACTION","147, 154, MODAL","23, 81, CONTENT","126, 133, ACTION"}
6537	While justifying the study, Authors must emphasize arguments being  important for the nutritional value of beans (factors reducing bioavailability), as well as nutrients intake in the indicated countries (iron deficiencies). While Authors concentrate on the arguments associated with fuel sources for cooking, or deforestation, it seems that such Introduction is not adequate for the study, or even it seems that the study is not adequate for Nutrients journal and should be rather submitted to the journal associated  with the sustainable production and consumption (e.g. Sustainability).	{"36, 40, MODAL","492, 589, CONTENT","51, 223, CONTENT","347, 359, LOCATION","465, 472, MODAL","481, 492, ACTION","40, 50, ACTION"}

6539	Lines 95-145 – the excessive information about YBP should be reduced . Authors should for the beginning  indicate why they refer the YBP (does the study present some chosen result of YBP or all the results; was YBP designed to verify the hypothesis of the presented study or was it a broaden initiative, etc.)	{"114, 309, CONTENT","15, 50, CONTENT","0, 14, LOCATION","61, 68, ACTION","105, 114, ACTION","79, 85, MODAL","50, 57, MODAL"}

6544	Defining the serving size on the basis of the USDA data is highly controversial. As Authors stated, that Phaseolus vulgaris L. is a typical product for Latin America, Caribbean and Africa, they must precisely define serving size on the basis of eating  behaviours typical for indicated areas, not on the basis of eating behaviours typical for USA. The USDA data may be indicated  as supplementary ones.	{"216, 291, CONTENT","380, 401, CONTENT","369, 379, ACTION","362, 365, MODAL","348, 361, CONTENT","293, 296, TRIGGER","194, 198, MODAL","209, 215, ACTION"}
6545	The statistical test applied to assess the normality of distribution should be indicated .	{"69, 76, MODAL","79, 88, ACTION","0, 68, CONTENT"}
6546	Authors presented in their tables only mean value, with no information about SD. Moreover, it was not indicated on the basis of how many measurements was it obtained.

6547	If the distribution is normal, the mean values should be presented  (accompanied by SD), but if it is different than normal, the median, accompanied by minimum and maximum values should be presented  – it should be specified  that distribution is normal if it is.	{"89, 92, TRIGGER","179, 185, MODAL","124, 179, CONTENT","205, 211, MODAL","0, 2, TRIGGER","231, 262, CONTENT","69, 86, CONTENT","30, 47, CONTENT","47, 54, MODAL","215, 224, ACTION","189, 199, ACTION","57, 66, ACTION"}

6549	Authors should combine the tables presented in this section, as a number of small tables is presented for the same genotypes and each information is now in the separate table. Author may design horizontal tables instead of vertical ones and combine a number of small tables into larger one. Afterwards, they may transfer the most important information from the supplementary material to the main body of the manuscript, as they should not refer the supplementary tables in the Results section – if they want to refer precisely to the data presented in the tables they should present them in the main body of the study.	{"223, 236, CONTENT","575, 583, ACTION","249, 289, CONTENT","241, 248, ACTION","47, 59, LOCATION","391, 418, LOCATION","428, 438, MODAL","477, 492, LOCATION","595, 617, LOCATION","8, 15, MODAL","15, 23, ACTION","23, 34, CONTENT","494, 497, TRIGGER","530, 562, CONTENT","183, 187, MODAL","187, 193, ACTION","439, 444, ACTION","211, 222, TRIGGER","308, 311, MODAL","449, 469, LOCATION","194, 211, CONTENT","311, 320, ACTION","357, 383, LOCATION","320, 351, CONTENT","567, 575, MODAL"}
6550	Figure 3 and Figure 4 are very small with a poor resolution, so should be changed  (preferably changed into tables to enable following the data).	{"95, 102, ACTION","74, 82, ACTION","0, 8, LOCATION","13, 21, LOCATION","103, 143, CONTENT","64, 70, MODAL"}

6552	Authors should not present the specific data and refer the supplementary material in this section (e.g. line 387), but focus on the discussion of results with no reproducing them unnecessarily.	{"8, 18, MODAL","19, 26, ACTION","26, 44, CONTENT","49, 55, ACTION","59, 81, LOCATION","85, 97, LOCATION","104, 112, LOCATION","113, 118, TRIGGER","118, 124, ACTION","125, 193, CONTENT"}
6553	Authors should discuss the own results on the basis of the results observed by other Authors, and the discussion should not be presented  in isolation from the own results (e.g. lines 366-376).	{"113, 123, MODAL","14, 22, ACTION","178, 191, LOCATION","22, 66, CONTENT","127, 136, ACTION","138, 171, CONTENT","98, 112, CONTENT","8, 14, MODAL"}

6555	As Authors did not include any assessment of sensory profile or consumer panel, some thesis are not justified (sub-chapter 4.5. – “… convenience, nutrition and taste”) and should be removed as they are not associated  with the objective of the study.	{"111, 127, LOCATION","11, 26, ACTION","182, 190, ACTION","26, 79, CONTENT","96, 109, ACTION","80, 91, CONTENT","172, 178, MODAL","130, 166, LOCATION"}
6556	The manuscript by Yan and co-workers introduces the preparation of magnetic porous carbon from bimetallic metal–organic frameworks, and its potential for norfloxacin removal from aqueous solutions. The topic is of interest to the readers of Nanomaterials. The research seems novel but it needs to be placed in context to the state-of-the-art. The manuscript has several minor and major technical and presentation issues, and therefore major revision is needed before further consideration.	{"287, 294, MODAL","299, 306, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION","281, 285, TRIGGER","306, 342, CONTENT","347, 357, LOCATION","256, 268, CONTENT"}
6557	1. Although mentioned in the title and Introduction section, the magnetic properties of the adsorbent have not been explored. The authors should demonstrate the advantage of the magnetic properties, and characterise it.	{"144, 157, ACTION","157, 197, CONTENT","29, 34, LOCATION","39, 59, LOCATION","138, 144, MODAL","203, 215, ACTION"}
6558	2. The physicochemical characterisations (e.g., XRD, Raman, XPS, SEM, TEM, EDX) of the control adsorbent (magnetic carbon (MC) prepared by MOFs with only Co) is missing, and needs to be included in the manuscript.	{"202, 212, LOCATION","186, 194, ACTION","161, 168, ACTION","2, 157, CONTENT","174, 179, MODAL"}
6559	3. In the last paragraph of the Introduction section, the authors made a hypothesis that“Co species can act as catalyst to improve the graphitization degree of MNPC”. However, there is no experimental proof to support it in this manuscript. Either provide evidence or refrain from making this conclusion.	{"10, 52, LOCATION","88, 165, LOCATION","267, 275, ACTION","224, 239, LOCATION","255, 265, CONTENT","247, 255, ACTION","275, 303, CONTENT","241, 247, TRIGGER","166, 175, TRIGGER","66, 70, ACTION"}
6560	4. Figure 1 is incorrect. Both the top left and bottom left structures are incorrect. The structures should depict 2-methylimidazole. The chemical structure of MNPC in the bottom left of the figure shows a precise molecular structure which does not represent MNPC accurately. A schematic figure must not contain any scientifically incorrect information.	{"312, 353, CONTENT","203, 233, CONTENT","197, 203, ACTION","132, 164, CONTENT","114, 132, CONTENT","107, 114, ACTION","101, 107, MODAL","304, 311, ACTION","86, 101, CONTENT","12, 24, ACTION","276, 294, CONTENT","25, 70, CONTENT","71, 84, ACTION","172, 197, LOCATION","240, 258, ACTION","259, 263, CONTENT","295, 303, MODAL","2, 12, LOCATION","234, 240, TRIGGER"}
6561	5. In the Synthesis of MNPC section where the mass of reagents were reported, the corresponding mole of reagents should be reported  as well, so that the readers have a clear understanding of the ratio of reagents used in the reaction, i.e. stoichiometry.	{"36, 112, CONTENT","113, 119, MODAL","123, 133, ACTION","10, 35, LOCATION"}
6562	6. The figure captions need to be more informative. For instance, in Figure 8, the authors need to include the experimental conditions (loading concentration, weight of adsorbent, solvent) because without these the removal rates have no meaning whatsoever. Similarly adjust the caption for Figure 10.	{"31, 50, ACTION","91, 96, MODAL","68, 78, LOCATION","107, 188, CONTENT","22, 28, MODAL","7, 22, LOCATION","290, 299, LOCATION","99, 106, ACTION","273, 285, CONTENT","266, 273, ACTION"}
6564	8. Magnetic adsorbents are green as they can be separated  easily from the solution. This point should be emphasized and elaborated  on. There is a global initiative toward sustainable solutions, the sustainability of the presented methodology should be emphasized . Examples for sustainable adsorption including materials and process perspectives should be given in the introduction: Green Chem., 2017, 19, 3116-3125; Waste Management, 2011, 31, 1350-1356; Green Chem., 2015, 17, 5196-5205.	{"106, 116, ACTION","96, 102, MODAL","121, 131, ACTION","371, 383, LOCATION","348, 354, MODAL","358, 363, ACTION","3, 83, CONTENT","267, 347, CONTENT","385, 490, CONTENT"}
6565	9. The discussion section (4) is short. One paragraph does not warrant to be an individual section. Merge this into the Results section. Figure 13 has no scientific meaning and does not add to the understanding of the manuscript, consequently it should be deleted .	{"100, 105, ACTION","246, 253, MODAL","120, 135, LOCATION","137, 147, LOCATION","30, 38, ACTION","7, 25, LOCATION","256, 263, ACTION"}

6568	12. Related reports on the use of pyrolysed bimetallic MOFs as adsorbents should be acknowledged , e.g., Journal of Chromatography A, 2017, 1479: 55-61 and Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 2018, 509: 245-253.	{"73, 80, MODAL","84, 96, ACTION","4, 73, CONTENT","105, 216, CONTENT"}
6569	13. In the second paragraph in the Introduction section, the authors mentioned that“developing multifunctional adsorbents with higher performance is still needed”. However, the adsorbent developed in the current work is used for adsorbing only one compound, norfloxacin. What is meant by multifunctional in this case?	{"11, 55, LOCATION","271, 275, TRIGGER","83, 162, LOCATION","276, 316, CONTENT","164, 173, TRIGGER"}
6570	14. The authors should mention in section 2.1 that the greenness of the fabrication method could be further improved  by sustainable recycling of the solvent (methanol) using membranes: ChemSusChem, 2017, 10, 3435-3444; J.

Such persons should be not indicated  as Authors of the study. Authors who did not participate in the manuscript preparing should be removed at all or just be presented  in Acknowledgements Section (if they contributed in any way).

6606	As Authors present the validation of EAT5 FFQ food frequency questionnaire, it is essential for readers to be able to get familiar with this tool.

6607	Authors should remember that for the validation of the FFQs, analysis of correlation is not a preferable method. It may be applied  as an additional one, but in the Abstract, Authors should present mainly the most important results, including those resulting from the analysis of Bland-Altman plots.	{"61, 84, CONTENT","33, 59, CONTENT","24, 32, TRIGGER","15, 23, ACTION","243, 298, CONTENT","116, 120, MODAL","8, 14, MODAL","165, 173, LOCATION","190, 198, ACTION","183, 189, MODAL","233, 242, ACTION","205, 231, CONTENT","154, 157, TRIGGER","132, 152, CONTENT","123, 130, ACTION","105, 111, CONTENT","88, 104, ACTION"}
6608	Authors properly justified the study, but should present a little bit broader perspective – for an international reader. As they conducted their study in a group of New Zealand children and the questionnaire was prepared for them, for international reader it is interesting what is specific in diet of New Zealand children while compared with other western countries.	{"42, 49, MODAL","31, 36, LOCATION","49, 57, ACTION","59, 89, CONTENT"}
6609	It is understandable, that the conducted analysis is a part of a broader study but Authors should not present the irrelevant elements in their manuscript – e.g. Authors indicated how was the weight, height measured and BMI calculated, but afterwards they did not use this data in their manuscript – such information should be removed  for better communicativeness of the manuscript.	{"114, 133, CONTENT","371, 381, LOCATION","316, 323, MODAL","143, 153, LOCATION","91, 97, MODAL","326, 335, ACTION","79, 82, TRIGGER","267, 276, CONTENT","255, 266, ACTION","235, 249, TRIGGER","161, 233, CONTENT","286, 296, LOCATION","299, 315, CONTENT","98, 109, ACTION","339, 363, CONTENT"}
6610	Sub-section 2.3. – as indicated above – readers should receive more specific information about applied FFQ (the frequencies, serving sizes, included products, groupings, etc.) – the FFQ applied for the study should be presented  as a supplementary material	{"0, 16, LOCATION","234, 256, LOCATION","178, 207, CONTENT","48, 55, MODAL","208, 214, MODAL","55, 63, ACTION","218, 229, ACTION","63, 175, CONTENT"}
6611	Authors should apply mainly the methods which are recommended for validation of the FFQs, while other should be indicated  as additional ones. Authors may address the recommendations of Cade (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12186666) in order to indicate in their Materials and Methods section, as well as other sections, proper perspective – they should focus on the most prominent results.	{"155, 163, ACTION","163, 237, CONTENT","151, 154, MODAL","8, 14, MODAL","28, 88, CONTENT","299, 309, TRIGGER","250, 259, ACTION","126, 141, CONTENT","15, 21, ACTION","238, 249, TRIGGER","123, 125, TRIGGER","102, 109, MODAL","96, 101, CONTENT","310, 324, LOCATION","90, 96, TRIGGER","112, 121, ACTION","352, 359, MODAL","326, 344, CONTENT","367, 394, CONTENT","359, 367, ACTION","268, 297, LOCATION"}

6613	While interpreting Bland-Altman plots, Authors should present the relevant criteria – they cannot state that their plots“indicated reasonably consistent agreement” but with no numeric criteria, based on the subjective visual assessment only. They can e.g. calculate Bland-Altman index and compare it with the 5% level (or alternatively with the 10% borderline significant level).	{"297, 299, CONTENT","164, 167, TRIGGER","289, 296, ACTION","120, 163, LOCATION","266, 284, CONTENT","98, 103, ACTION","91, 97, MODAL","6, 37, CONTENT","104, 108, TRIGGER","62, 83, CONTENT","0, 5, TRIGGER","300, 304, TRIGGER","305, 378, CONTENT","109, 120, LOCATION","168, 172, TRIGGER","173, 192, CONTENT","194, 235, CONTENT","236, 240, TRIGGER","47, 54, MODAL","54, 62, ACTION","256, 266, ACTION","247, 251, MODAL"}
6614	There is an important limitation of the study which is the fact that there were a food items in the FFQ that were from more than one NOVA category – it should be extensively discussed in terms of what should be done for better applicability of assessed FFQ for indicated  aim.	{"46, 54, TRIGGER","12, 32, CONTENT","40, 45, LOCATION","196, 200, TRIGGER","55, 146, CONTENT","152, 159, MODAL","201, 275, CONTENT","174, 184, ACTION"}
6615	There are some limitations of the study which were underestimated. Authors focused mainly on the strengths, while especially limitations should be listed and extensively discussed  (e.g. overestimation of energy intake – is it known if it results from overestimation of all the products or only some of them?, etc.).	{"125, 137, CONTENT","187, 307, CONTENT","34, 40, LOCATION","15, 26, CONTENT","137, 144, MODAL","147, 154, ACTION","170, 181, ACTION"}

6617	The manuscript presents a computer-aided design of imprinted scavengers. The work is of interest to a broader audience from the sensor, imprinting, molecular recognition and environmental fields. The work is novel, however, setting the background needs to be improved, grammar mistakes and informal language must be corrected , and some scientific details need clarification. Suggested improvements are outlined below.	{"361, 374, ACTION","259, 267, ACTION","356, 360, MODAL","337, 355, CONTENT","316, 325, ACTION","247, 255, MODAL","269, 307, CONTENT","215, 222, TRIGGER","308, 313, MODAL","4, 15, LOCATION","224, 246, CONTENT"}
6618	1) The word“molecular” can be removed  from the title of the manuscript. Avoid informal and vague language such as“matched the DCD molecules very well”,“are relatively uniform”,“result maybe indicates”,“the rest calculations”.	{"48, 71, LOCATION","202, 225, LOCATION","177, 201, LOCATION","23, 27, MODAL","115, 151, LOCATION","30, 39, ACTION","73, 78, ACTION","152, 176, LOCATION","107, 114, TRIGGER","79, 106, CONTENT","11, 22, LOCATION"}
6619	2) The abstract is somewhat vague. Statements such as“the best functional monomer” and“the best cross-linker” should be rephrased  in a more accurate way. They are“best” in what way? There are several criteria for monomers and cross-linkers.	{"7, 16, LOCATION","155, 163, TRIGGER","35, 45, CONTENT","28, 33, ACTION","53, 82, LOCATION","110, 117, MODAL","86, 109, LOCATION","46, 53, TRIGGER","131, 153, CONTENT","170, 181, CONTENT","163, 169, LOCATION","120, 129, ACTION"}
6620	3) The authors propose DCD:MAA to be 1:5 ratio. How does such an interaction happen involving only one DCD and 5 MAA? A figure showing the interacting atoms could guide the readers.	{"135, 156, CONTENT","23, 30, LOCATION","157, 162, MODAL","169, 180, CONTENT","163, 168, ACTION","127, 134, ACTION","118, 126, LOCATION","57, 116, CONTENT","48, 56, TRIGGER","37, 46, LOCATION"}
6621	4) Molecular imprinting is more than 40 years old and thus the statement that it is a“new technology” (line 35) should be reconsidered .	{"3, 49, CONTENT","54, 58, TRIGGER","59, 85, CONTENT","85, 101, LOCATION","112, 119, MODAL","122, 134, ACTION","103, 110, LOCATION"}

6623	6) Were the calculations done in gas phase or acetonitrile? The calculations were done at 333K, the same temperature as the polymerisation takes place?	{"3, 7, TRIGGER","8, 58, CONTENT","60, 150, CONTENT"}
6624	7) In Line 83-84 the calculation methods are listed. On what basis were these methods selected? Some justification and brief comparison of the selected methods need to be included in the manuscript.	{"160, 167, MODAL","61, 94, CONTENT","21, 40, CONTENT","136, 159, CONTENT","125, 135, ACTION","187, 197, LOCATION","6, 16, LOCATION","101, 114, ACTION","171, 179, ACTION","56, 60, TRIGGER"}
6625	8) Previous reports on the imprinting of the same template for the same purpose should be acknowledged  in the introduction section (Biosensors and Bioelectronics, 2016, 77, 512–517; Talanta, 2015, 134, 761?767).	{"3, 79, CONTENT","80, 87, MODAL","90, 102, ACTION","111, 131, LOCATION","133, 210, CONTENT"}
6626	9) Limited examples (lines 45-56) for the application areas of imprinting are given which should be complemented  with recent works on drug delivery (ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 2015, 7 (18), 9516–9525), proteomics (Chem. Asian J. 2009, 4, 286–293), and wastewater treatment (Green Chem., 2015, 17, 5196-5205).	{"100, 112, ACTION","21, 32, LOCATION","3, 19, CONTENT","34, 73, CONTENT","119, 310, CONTENT","90, 96, MODAL"}
6627	10) Table 2 shows only some template:functional monomer ratios. Data for 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4 and 1:5 ratios should be included in the table to demonstrate that indeed  the 1:5 DCD:MAA is the best choice for the preparation of the imprinted polymers.	{"133, 138, LOCATION","159, 247, CONTENT","154, 158, TRIGGER","142, 153, ACTION","23, 62, CONTENT","12, 22, ACTION","64, 107, CONTENT","117, 125, ACTION","107, 113, MODAL","4, 11, LOCATION"}

6629	12) Figure 4, panel B, the ratios on the x axis are insufficient to interpret the data. It should be clarified what those ratios actually are. The caption of Figure 4 needs to include the conditions for adsorption (e.g. solvent, feed concentration, amount of adsorbent, time…)	{"176, 183, ACTION","143, 166, LOCATION","4, 21, LOCATION","101, 111, ACTION","91, 98, MODAL","23, 33, CONTENT","41, 47, LOCATION","65, 86, CONTENT","111, 115, TRIGGER","52, 64, ACTION","116, 141, CONTENT","167, 172, MODAL","184, 276, CONTENT"}
6630	13) 1:5 molar ratio represents a significant excess of MAA compared to the template. At such concentrations self-association of MAA can occur. Was self-association taken into account for the calculations? If yes data should be shown, if not then at least the possibility of self-association of MAA functional monomer should be mentioned and relevant literature cited  (Spectrochim.

6632	The review article by Ang and co-workers gives an overview of a subfield of natural coagulants. There is a need for such a review from the angle chosen by the authors. The topic fits well within the scope of the journal. However, there is room for improvement, the context and background need to be improved, and more aspects of the topic included. This reviewer recommends major revision to address the points below before a final decision can be made.	{"288, 292, MODAL","221, 228, TRIGGER","265, 287, CONTENT","309, 347, CONTENT","299, 307, ACTION"}
6633	1, Some critical analysis on the greenness/sustainability of the presented methodologies should be added . For instance what are the green extraction technologies? Which are the currently employed techniques that pose a significant environmental burden, and are there any alternatives? These discussions would also help to show the way forward for the subject field.	{"120, 162, CONTENT","89, 96, MODAL","286, 303, CONTENT","320, 365, CONTENT","3, 88, CONTENT","164, 169, TRIGGER","304, 310, MODAL","169, 284, CONTENT","99, 104, ACTION","315, 319, ACTION"}
6634	2, Biopolymers are compounds and not approaches. Therefore the title should be revised , for instance ‘biopolymers as Green Solutions for…’ or ‘biopolymers as Green Coagulants for…’ might be better expressions.	{"102, 209, CONTENT","69, 76, MODAL","63, 69, LOCATION","79, 86, ACTION"}

6636	4, The title of section 2 is ‘Production of natural coagulants’ but most of the examples in this part of the review are literature-based and in research stage at lab-scale without any proven large-scale production. The word production is misleading in the title and instead ‘obtaining’, ‘preparation’ or something similar should be used .	{"322, 328, MODAL","29, 63, LOCATION","235, 248, ACTION","256, 261, LOCATION","266, 273, TRIGGER","273, 321, CONTENT","64, 67, TRIGGER","332, 336, ACTION","7, 25, LOCATION","215, 234, CONTENT"}
6637	5, The introduction is relatively short and does not set the scene. It starts in medias res without placing the topic of water treatment in context.

6638	6, Mention briefly the trend towards green and sustainable water treatment, which is an increasingly important topic, and mention examples from different sectors such as microbial fuel cells (DOI 10.1039/C3EE43106A), adsorption (10.1039/C5GC01937K), nanogenerators (10.1002/aenm.201501778), natural waste (10.1002/ep.11750), electrodialysis (10.1039/C8TA09160A), bioreactors (10.22207/JPAM.13.1.41), microalgae (10.1007/978-981-13-2264-8_22).	{"122, 130, ACTION","130, 441, CONTENT","19, 116, CONTENT","3, 11, ACTION"}
6639	7, The use of biopolymers and plant based materials for green purposes should be exemplified  as their use has been increasing, and they penetrate into various fields (keratin 10.1039/C9GC03896E, bamboo 10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b02516; lotus leaf 10.1039/C9GC03254A; fatty acid 10.1002/adma.201703702; biocoatings 10.1021/acsapm.8b00161; polyglucose 10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b03219; ).

6640	8, The authors should add a table with emerging  biopolymers and natural materials that have not been used for this purpose but have a good potential and should be explored  in the future. Again this would help to show the way forward and would improve the manuscript by adding  future perspective.	{"22, 25, ACTION","189, 195, TRIGGER","15, 22, MODAL","154, 161, MODAL","164, 174, ACTION","28, 149, CONTENT","200, 205, MODAL","239, 245, MODAL","206, 211, ACTION","245, 253, ACTION","257, 268, LOCATION","211, 234, CONTENT","268, 297, CONTENT"}
6641	9, Some of the natural coagulants works (including modelling studies) are missing from the review and the authors should mention them in the relevant places, DOIs 10.5402/2011/632189, 10.4172/2157-7463.1000374, modelling 10.5004/dwt.2019.23871, modelling 10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.117622.	{"70, 81, ACTION","3, 69, CONTENT","129, 284, CONTENT","91, 98, LOCATION","114, 121, MODAL","121, 129, ACTION"}

6645	Authors presented the information, that their study“was exempt by the Institutional Review Board”, but with no details – who made the exemption and why? which specific Institutional Review Board was engaged? did the exactly Institutional Review Board made the exemption and if so, what is the reference (number of decision)?	{"46, 51, LOCATION","125, 151, CONTENT","153, 158, TRIGGER","159, 206, CONTENT","208, 269, CONTENT","281, 286, TRIGGER","293, 323, CONTENT","99, 102, TRIGGER","51, 97, LOCATION","108, 118, ACTION","121, 124, TRIGGER"}
6646	In general, in the case of studies involving human subjects, the agreement of the ethics committee is compulsory – as it is defined:‘No one should participate in research unless independent review concludes that the risks are reasonable in relation to the potential benefits.’ (National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) - https://bioethicsarchive.georgetown.edu/nbac/human/oversumm.html).	{"12, 98, CONTENT","99, 112, ACTION","132, 391, CONTENT"}

6661	The exclusion criteria seem to be controversial – Authors should precisely describe what were the reasons to not apply the recommended treatment in the case of some assessed individuals. They indicated, that there are some recommendations of treatment, but afterwards they stated that a number of patients were treated in the other way – it seems to be not justified.	{"0, 47, CONTENT","84, 88, TRIGGER","89, 185, CONTENT","253, 257, TRIGGER","58, 65, MODAL","75, 83, ACTION","353, 366, ACTION","287, 335, CONTENT"}

6738	The work is of interest to the readers of the journal but there are some major issues that must be addressed  before publication. The results are missing from the manuscript. The introduction should refer to the relevant literature for which suggestions are given below.	{"175, 191, CONTENT","91, 96, MODAL","99, 110, ACTION","192, 199, MODAL","142, 153, ACTION","130, 141, CONTENT","163, 173, LOCATION","73, 85, CONTENT","54, 58, TRIGGER","199, 204, ACTION","205, 231, CONTENT"}
6739	1) On what basis was 2-oxindole (having aromatic and amide moieties) selected as the dummy template for the polymer synthesis? Its chemical characteristics are different from patulin (ester, hydroxyl, ether functionalities). The assumed secondary interactions between the template-functional monomer and dummy template-functional monomer should be depicted  in a scheme.	{"358, 370, CONTENT","348, 356, ACTION","338, 345, MODAL","3, 125, CONTENT","225, 337, CONTENT"}
6740	3) A brief explanation at the beginning of the article should be given why the unusual“stir-bar” type format was used for the extraction and not the conventional microspheres.	{"55, 61, MODAL","3, 22, CONTENT","30, 54, LOCATION","71, 74, TRIGGER","75, 174, CONTENT","65, 71, ACTION"}
6741	4) The introduction should acknowledge other work in the field of imprinted polymers for juice analyses (Cao et al. J. Sep. Sci., 2013, 36, 1291-1297; Ashley et al. Biosensors and Bioelectronics, 2017, 91, 606-615; Yu et al. Toxins, 2010, 2, 1536-1553; You et al. J. Sep Sci., 2016, 39, 2831-2838; Martin-Esteban et al, J. Sep.

6742	5) Acetic acid-methanol was applied for desorption of patulin which is a cyclic ester. Did the authors notice any degradation of patulin (ring opening and transesterification)?	{"87, 91, TRIGGER","103, 175, CONTENT"}
6743	6) Was the reusability of the imprinted polymers evaluated? Imprinted polymers, especially the ones crosslinked with DVB are stable over a long time and can be reused  (Kupai et al. Polym. Chem., 2017, 8, 666–673) which should be mentioned  in the manuscript.	{"2, 6, TRIGGER","248, 258, LOCATION","220, 226, MODAL","169, 212, CONTENT","160, 166, ACTION","153, 157, MODAL","230, 241, ACTION","60, 148, CONTENT","7, 58, CONTENT"}
6744	7) After line 120, the authors should mention that molecular imprinting  has not only been used for analytical purposes but also for large scale environmental applications recently (Razali et al. Green Chem., 2015, 17, 5196–5205) and consequently the novel patulin-imprinted polymers could potentially be used for detoxification of fruit juices besides the analytical application.	{"284, 290, MODAL","3, 17, LOCATION","46, 229, CONTENT","247, 283, CONTENT","314, 379, CONTENT","305, 310, ACTION","31, 38, MODAL","38, 45, ACTION"}
6745	8) For the general statement in line 129 ref [5] should be replaced  with a recent review or book chapter on the topic, e.g. Chen et al. Chem. Soc. Rev., 2016, 45, 2137–2211.	{"69, 174, CONTENT","41, 48, LOCATION","49, 56, MODAL","59, 69, ACTION","32, 40, LOCATION"}

6747	10) The adsorption capacities and recoveries should be presented  in the manuscript. Basically there is no data/results presented in the manuscript in its current version.	{"73, 83, LOCATION","4, 44, CONTENT","45, 52, MODAL","55, 66, ACTION","137, 147, LOCATION"}
6748	11) What was the LOD/LOQ of the MS method for the detection of the analyte?	{"9, 74, CONTENT","4, 8, TRIGGER"}
6749	12) The conclusion section needs to include quantitative details, the limitations and drawbacks of the proposed methodology should be mentioned .	{"36, 44, ACTION","134, 144, ACTION","27, 32, MODAL","66, 123, CONTENT","44, 64, CONTENT","124, 131, MODAL","8, 26, LOCATION"}
6750	13) What is the theoretical maximum number of binding sites in unit mass of polymers (based on the template amount used for polymer preparation)? How does this value compare with the observed adsorption capacity?	{"9, 144, CONTENT","4, 9, TRIGGER","150, 211, CONTENT","146, 150, TRIGGER"}
6751	The manuscript entitled“Sleep duration is inversely associated with serum uric acid concentrations and uric acid to creatinine ratio in an elderly Mediterranean population at high cardiovascular risk” presents interesting issue, but it requires some corrections before being published.	{"236, 245, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION","23, 200, LOCATION","229, 233, TRIGGER","245, 261, CONTENT"}
6752	One major ethical problem is associated with the authorship. It is understandable that in case of a large study there are a number of authors (there are 52 Authors of the prepared manuscript), but all of them must participate actively in the manuscript preparation. All Authors must at least participate in critical review of the manuscript (if not participate in writing it).	{"214, 226, ACTION","226, 264, CONTENT","180, 190, LOCATION","193, 197, TRIGGER","209, 214, MODAL","278, 282, MODAL","292, 304, ACTION","304, 375, CONTENT"}
6753	1.      Based on Authors Contributions section, in fact there are only 2 Authors who prepared the manuscript (as specified – CP and JSS analysed the data and wrote the manuscript). But majority of other Authors only participated in data gathering. In such situation, if they did not participate in manuscript preparation, they should not be indicated  as authors, but rather mentioned in Acknowledgements section.	{"98, 109, LOCATION","275, 294, ACTION","298, 320, CONTENT","267, 270, TRIGGER","364, 368, TRIGGER","17, 46, LOCATION","388, 412, LOCATION","181, 184, TRIGGER","341, 350, ACTION","327, 337, MODAL","375, 385, ACTION"}
6754	2.      Based on Authors Contributions section, there are some Authors (e.g. NBT) who did nothing for the study and did nothing for the manuscript preparation (is not indicated in Authors Contributions section at all).

6755	Authors should remember, that the“guest authorship” is the forbidden procedure. Authors who did not participate in the manuscript preparing should be removed at all or just be presented  in Acknowledgements Section. If they participated actively in the study and creating manuscript, as well as performed critical revisions of the manuscript and accepted the publication of the data, they should be indicated , but their contributions should be clearly specified .	{"421, 434, CONTENT","190, 214, LOCATION","80, 139, CONTENT","30, 78, CONTENT","453, 463, ACTION","435, 442, MODAL","411, 415, TRIGGER","8, 15, MODAL","140, 147, MODAL","150, 158, ACTION","389, 396, MODAL","176, 187, ACTION","15, 23, ACTION","399, 409, ACTION","216, 382, CONTENT"}

6774	The manuscript by Li and co-workers investigates a SWIS. The topic is of interest to both professionals and academics working in the field wastewater treatment. The work fits well within the scope of the journal, however the novelty needs to be clarified, the context needs to be broadened, and some technical aspects need to be improved. There are several issues that must be addressed  prior to further consideration by IJERPH. The manuscript needs to be reconsidered after having carefully addressed the comments listed below:	{"4, 14, LOCATION","294, 317, CONTENT","256, 267, CONTENT","221, 232, CONTENT","470, 529, CONTENT","457, 470, ACTION","445, 451, MODAL","434, 445, LOCATION","349, 363, CONTENT","377, 388, ACTION","369, 373, MODAL","329, 337, ACTION","318, 322, MODAL","280, 289, ACTION","268, 273, MODAL","245, 254, ACTION","233, 239, MODAL","213, 221, TRIGGER"}

6789	The novel work by Silva et al. is of interest to the analytical chemistry community. The work is detailed enough to ensure understanding, the majority of the manuscript reads well and built in a logical manner. Nonetheless, the manuscript needs to be improved and some points clarified prior to publication. The introduction is too narrow and needs to discuss the broader context for which recommendations have been given, and the data representation needs some corrections.	{"360, 421, CONTENT","426, 450, CONTENT","462, 473, ACTION","264, 275, CONTENT","276, 286, ACTION","251, 260, ACTION","228, 239, LOCATION","239, 245, MODAL","211, 222, TRIGGER","312, 324, LOCATION","325, 338, ACTION","343, 349, MODAL","352, 360, ACTION","451, 457, MODAL"}

6805	The manuscript by Muthana and co-workers details the fabrication, characterization and application of new polymer blend nanofiltration membranes. The results are new and of interest to the readers of Membranes. The work has a good potential impact. On the other hand, there are several issues with the manuscript that must be addressed  prior to further consideration by the journal.	{"278, 292, CONTENT","326, 337, ACTION","318, 323, MODAL","302, 312, LOCATION","4, 15, LOCATION"}
6806	1. The authors should clarify the rationale for the selection of the two polymers used to prepare the blends (PES and PPSU). Why PES was used as an additive and not vice versa?	{"125, 128, TRIGGER","22, 29, ACTION","129, 175, CONTENT","30, 123, CONTENT","15, 21, MODAL"}

6811	7. The authors should also add a critical note that the manufacturing  of polymer membranes via phase inversion generates a significant amount of wastewater, which needs to be minimised and treated (Green Chem. 2015, 17, 5196-5205).	{"199, 230, CONTENT","27, 31, ACTION","176, 186, ACTION","15, 22, MODAL","31, 156, CONTENT","190, 197, ACTION","164, 170, MODAL"}

6868	7. The authors solely cited themselves under“extensive body of literature” (line 45) for enantioselective MIPs, which should be complimented with efforts that achieved  outstanding enantioseparation (J. Sep. Sci., 2013, 36, 3449-3456; ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 2015, 7, 9516-9525; Talanta, 2016, 152, 277-282).	{"45, 73, LOCATION","118, 125, MODAL","76, 83, LOCATION","128, 140, ACTION","140, 315, CONTENT"}
6869	8. The conclusion section needs to include the main research outcomes in a quantitative manner.	{"35, 42, ACTION","47, 94, CONTENT","7, 25, LOCATION","26, 31, MODAL"}
6870	9. Some general conclusions should be drawn from the data, which can guide the readers for the application of the pivot-enhanced enantioseparation. In general, the impact and general use of the methodology is not clear in the manuscript.	{"206, 218, ACTION","226, 236, LOCATION","160, 205, CONTENT","43, 57, CONTENT","3, 27, CONTENT","38, 43, ACTION","28, 34, MODAL"}
6873	12. Most of the discussions under section 3 are wordy and too long. The text should be shorted , more sharp, and concise.	{"44, 53, ACTION","77, 83, MODAL","58, 66, ACTION","15, 27, CONTENT","68, 76, CONTENT","97, 121, CONTENT","34, 43, LOCATION","87, 94, ACTION"}
6875	1) The chemical structure of the charged polymer should be included  in the manuscript.	{"59, 67, ACTION","48, 56, MODAL","76, 86, LOCATION","3, 48, CONTENT"}
6876	2) The aspects of novelty and significance of this research have to be highlighted in the manuscript.	{"90, 100, LOCATION","71, 82, ACTION","3, 42, CONTENT","60, 64, MODAL"}
6877	3) The overview is weak and the used references are not up to date. The following articles on skim milk processing should be discussed : https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2015.07.010; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2004.09.022; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2010.12.026.	{"7, 15, LOCATION","137, 276, CONTENT","16, 23, ACTION","125, 134, ACTION","114, 121, MODAL","37, 47, CONTENT","52, 66, ACTION","68, 114, CONTENT"}
6878	4) A short paragraph on various membrane cascades should be included  to set the scene and introduce the work from a wider context: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2016.04.056; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11947-016-1848-1; https://doi.org/10.1080/01496390701444121.	{"3, 49, CONTENT","73, 86, ACTION","91, 100, ACTION","60, 68, ACTION","50, 56, MODAL","132, 263, CONTENT"}
6879	5) Style of parameters in the manuscript does not fit IUPAC recommendations. See below a guide on the use of italic and roman font for scientific symbols. https://iupac.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ICTNS-On-the-use-of-italic-and-roman-fonts-for-symbols-in-scientific-text.pdf	{"2, 23, CONTENT","30, 40, LOCATION","53, 75, CONTENT","46, 53, ACTION"}

6881	7) The process schemes do not contain process related information and they are simple“copies” from a text book. The authors should provide concrete progress configurations (inc. valves, pumps, flow rates, streams etc.) and discuss the different settings of the system afterwards. Only then the text can be easily followed  and understood.	{"124, 131, MODAL","139, 219, CONTENT","131, 138, ACTION","25, 37, ACTION","7, 22, LOCATION","37, 65, CONTENT","231, 278, CONTENT","70, 110, CONTENT","223, 230, ACTION"}
6882	8) Figure 1. Is incorrect. Both the retentate and permeate streams leave from the same side of the membrane.	{"3, 12, LOCATION","27, 108, CONTENT","13, 25, ACTION"}
6883	9) Style of equations does not meet the scientific standards and they are barely understandable. Moreover, authors should define the number of equations prior to discussing  them, e.g. line 80.	{"74, 95, ACTION","12, 21, LOCATION","185, 192, LOCATION","115, 121, MODAL","122, 178, CONTENT"}
6884	10) Units are not unequivocal all over the manuscript, e.g. line 117:“810 L/m2/h” ?“810 L m-2 h-1”. Correct them, and follow the latter style as per the IUPAC guidance.	{"83, 98, LOCATION","4, 9, LOCATION","43, 53, LOCATION","69, 81, LOCATION","129, 168, CONTENT","14, 29, ACTION","100, 107, ACTION","60, 68, LOCATION","117, 124, ACTION","108, 113, CONTENT"}
6885	11) The surface modification of membranes, and its versatility, should also be briefly discussed giving  several examples to place the work in a wider context: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es9003697; https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscatal.8b01706; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2017.11.070.	{"105, 121, CONTENT","87, 96, ACTION","160, 304, CONTENT","64, 70, MODAL","4, 62, CONTENT","97, 103, ACTION"}
6886	12) Line 119:“The feed stream pressure was 2 bar and the differential pressure on the retentate channel was 0.3 bar or less” Value of pressure should be defined  precisely.	{"4, 12, LOCATION","14, 124, LOCATION","153, 160, ACTION","125, 142, CONTENT","143, 149, MODAL"}
6887	13) Table 2. is chaotic, should be reorganised  as per publishing standards and requirements.	{"4, 11, LOCATION","35, 46, ACTION","13, 23, ACTION","46, 93, CONTENT","25, 31, MODAL"}
6888	15) The Conclusion section is missing from the manuscript. It is necessary to summarise main findings in a concise and quantitative way.	{"4, 26, CONTENT","78, 87, ACTION","29, 38, ACTION","87, 136, CONTENT","47, 57, LOCATION"}
6889	The article entitled“Relative validity and reproducibility of a Food Frequency Questionnaire to assess intakes of total and free sugars for use in early childhood dental studies” presents an interesting issue but some corrections are needed. In spite of the fact, that the manuscript presents a valuable study, the presentation is in some aspects quite poor.	{"20, 178, LOCATION","218, 240, ACTION","273, 283, LOCATION"}
6890	(1)    It should be specified , if conducted study included only validation of the questionnaire, or it included designing and validation of the questionnaire. The article is presented as if the aim was only validation (it is specified in the Introduction, presented methodology does not include many details associated with the construction of the questionnaire). However, two of the Authors (AB, LD) did not take part in the validation and preparing manuscript, but only in the questionnaire designing. It should be explained  and Authors should correct this inconsistency.	{"20, 29, ACTION","10, 16, MODAL","508, 515, MODAL","365, 373, TRIGGER","518, 527, ACTION","373, 503, CONTENT","548, 555, ACTION","541, 547, MODAL","560, 574, CONTENT","243, 255, LOCATION","32, 34, TRIGGER","35, 96, CONTENT","98, 100, TRIGGER","101, 158, CONTENT","267, 278, LOCATION","279, 295, ACTION","296, 362, CONTENT"}
6891	(2)    The term“FFQ (Food frequency questionnaire)”, in general does not relate to the specific questionnaire applied by Authors, but it is the type of method. The applied FFQ should be specified , in the whole text (does it have any name/ appellation?). If possible, Authors should use other term (e.g. SMILE-FFQ) to provide for readers the necessary information about what questionnaire was applied.	{"198, 216, LOCATION","318, 325, ACTION","282, 286, ACTION","276, 282, MODAL","304, 313, CONTENT","186, 195, ACTION","64, 79, ACTION","16, 51, LOCATION","342, 400, CONTENT","160, 176, CONTENT","176, 182, MODAL","286, 298, CONTENT","217, 252, CONTENT"}
6892	(3)    The groups of products included into questionnaire should be specified  (e.g. as a supplementary material), as well as frequencies should be presented . As the readers do not know the applied questionnaire, the presented validation without presenting questionnaire is for readers useless.	{"148, 157, ACTION","58, 64, MODAL","68, 77, ACTION","6, 58, CONTENT","126, 137, CONTENT","138, 144, MODAL","90, 112, LOCATION"}

6898	(1)    Authors indicated, that the study was conducted in the mother-toddler pairs, but I’m not sure if they really did, as it is not indicated in the Results section. The information, that it was conducted in mother-toddler pairs means, that both mothers and toddlers fulfilled questionnaires. If only mothers did – Authors should indicate, that the study was conducted in a group of mothers of toddlers.	{"130, 143, ACTION","295, 325, CONTENT","7, 129, CONTENT","151, 166, LOCATION","341, 404, CONTENT","332, 340, ACTION","325, 331, MODAL"}

6910	(14) Lines 33-34 – Was the distribution normal after transformation?	{"27, 68, CONTENT","5, 16, LOCATION","19, 22, TRIGGER"}
6911	(15) Was the Bland-Altman plot constructed on the basis of the data after transformation? It should be constructed  on the basis of the non-transformed data, as the data for Bland-Altman plot do not have to be normally distributed.	{"174, 191, LOCATION","93, 99, MODAL","103, 114, ACTION","4, 8, TRIGGER","210, 230, CONTENT","192, 203, ACTION","116, 156, CONTENT","31, 88, CONTENT","13, 30, LOCATION"}

Among limitations of the study are e.g. the fact, that participants were entered into the study in various months, that may had changed their diet (due to typical season-related variations of diet) or excluding“child in childcare” days. Among the limitations of the FFQ, especially those associated with the possibility to assess the intake of specific products must be indicated . Taking into account an example indicated in the Materials and methods section, it seems hard to assess the amount of sugar sprinkled on cereal. Other limitation of the questionnaire is the overestimation.	{"11, 29, LOCATION","72, 131, CONTENT","621, 657, CONTENT","495, 499, MODAL","563, 593, LOCATION","503, 512, ACTION","370, 494, CONTENT","603, 617, ACTION","53, 59, MODAL","59, 67, ACTION","343, 363, LOCATION"}

6923	1) The novelty of the study should be clearly stated  in the abstract, conclusions and the end of the introduction. TNT imprinting as well as the Meisenheimer complexation approach for TNT are both well-studied and there are numerous reports in the literature. What is the authors’ novel contribution to this field?	{"28, 34, MODAL","70, 82, LOCATION","91, 114, LOCATION","3, 28, CONTENT","61, 70, LOCATION","46, 52, ACTION","261, 265, TRIGGER","269, 314, CONTENT"}

6925	3) The authors should clarify the thickness of the films, the control and importance of thickness. There is only limited information on this and it is scattered throughout the manuscript. A more comprehensive description is needed.	{"188, 208, CONTENT","15, 21, MODAL","176, 186, LOCATION","22, 29, ACTION","29, 97, CONTENT","224, 230, MODAL","209, 220, ACTION"}

6928	7) The introduction is fairly short and should have a paragraph on imprinted films and their versatile applications such as precious metal recovery (Materials, 2017, 10, 1133), drug delivery (Journal of Biomaterials Science, Polymer Edition 2017, 28, 519-531), ternary mixture separation (React. Funct. Polym., 2015, 86, 215-224), electrodes (J. Mater. Chem. A, 2016, 4, 13989-13996).	{"47, 51, ACTION","7, 19, LOCATION","52, 384, CONTENT","40, 46, MODAL"}

6930	9) The ability to reuse MIPs multiple times is crucial for sensor applications. The authors should explicitly mention the need for carefully designed elution techniques to avoid the degradation of the materials, and ensure their long lifetime (Polymer Chem., 2017, 8, 666-673).	{"110, 117, ACTION","92, 98, MODAL","117, 279, CONTENT"}
6931	10) The ambiguous x/y format for unit should be avoided , and the IUPAC-recommended x y-1 format should be used  instead throughout the text, figures and tables.	{"18, 38, CONTENT","38, 44, MODAL","48, 55, ACTION","65, 96, CONTENT","97, 103, MODAL","107, 111, ACTION","136, 140, LOCATION","142, 149, LOCATION","154, 160, LOCATION"}

6992	1) The Introduction is weak and does not provide an appropriate context of the research. Applications of magnesium-silicate in water treatment needs to be discussed. Cost efficiency needs to be backed up with some references. Authors should emphasize novelty and significance of their investigation, and clearly mention what the shortcoming of the previously reported approaches are, which would justify the need for the presented work in the manuscript.	{"241, 250, ACTION","203, 224, CONTENT","194, 203, ACTION","251, 300, CONTENT","182, 187, MODAL","312, 319, ACTION","89, 142, CONTENT","166, 181, LOCATION","154, 165, ACTION","143, 148, MODAL","20, 27, ACTION","320, 324, TRIGGER","32, 48, ACTION","234, 240, MODAL","49, 87, CONTENT","325, 382, CONTENT","7, 19, LOCATION"}

6995	5) The authors should discuss reproducibility of the nanoparticle preparation and the adsorption results. There are no error bars on any graphs. Were there any measurements for independently prepared adsorbents? Robustness of preparation and application should be discussed . The importance of regeneration and careful selection of regeneration method of adsorbents to avoid adsorbent degradation were described in the literature and should be emphasised  in the manuscript (Polymer Chem., 2017, 8, 666-673). What are the specific criteria for the reported nanoparticles?	{"145, 149, TRIGGER","463, 473, LOCATION","276, 429, CONTENT","212, 253, CONTENT","150, 210, CONTENT","15, 21, MODAL","22, 29, ACTION","30, 104, CONTENT","253, 260, MODAL","264, 273, ACTION","434, 440, MODAL","444, 454, ACTION","474, 507, CONTENT","509, 571, CONTENT"}

7001	11) The trend in water and wastewater treatment is continuously moving towards more sustainable materials and technologies, which should be mentioned  in the introduction (Green Chem. 2015, 17, 5196-5205). The choice of the adsorbent, magnesium silicate, can be considered  as a sustainable and non-harmful source for adsorption, which is a good effort towards sustainable processes. A discussion on the topic should be provided  in the manuscript.	{"129, 136, MODAL","172, 203, CONTENT","140, 149, ACTION","410, 416, MODAL","206, 410, CONTENT","420, 428, ACTION","4, 124, CONTENT","158, 170, LOCATION","437, 447, LOCATION"}

7016	10. The blocks’ diameter was found to be 10 um (line 99). This needs to be quantified with an imaging software and the average should be given with a standard deviation.

7024	18.“highly effective and recyclable adsorbent” in line 188: The recycling shows rapid deterioration of the adsorbent at a constant rate of about 2% decrease in adsorption per cycle. The importance of adsorption regeneration should be mentioned and exemplified  (Polym. Chem., 2017, 8, 666-673).

7075	The manuscript by Yang and co-workers details the preparation and application of a composite WO3-UiO-66 catalyst. The work can be considered  as novel with a reasonable potential impact. The conclusions are supported by the data. However, there are several flaws, technical and presentation issues. The context needs to be improved and the background broadened as the introduction is too specific. Consequently, the manuscript needs to be thoroughly revised before further consideration to be published in Nanomaterials.	{"299, 310, CONTENT","264, 297, CONTENT","381, 396, ACTION","256, 262, CONTENT","230, 237, TRIGGER","339, 351, CONTENT","323, 331, ACTION","449, 457, ACTION","427, 432, MODAL","412, 426, LOCATION","368, 380, LOCATION"}

7081	6. The images in Figure 4d-e are too blurred (low resolution) to be able to safely conclude that the size is indeed 3.75 nm and 5.19 nm.

7091	16. The experimental work involved undesired chemicals such as DMF, peroxide. The authors should mention that the use of them should be minimised  and in order to increase the sustainability of the synthesis, they should be sustainably recovered  using membranes (ChemSusChem, 2017, 10, 3435–3444).	{"110, 125, CONTENT","90, 96, MODAL","97, 104, ACTION","126, 132, MODAL","247, 297, CONTENT","151, 208, CONTENT","136, 145, ACTION","8, 25, LOCATION","236, 245, ACTION","214, 220, MODAL"}

7094	The review is of interest to the MIP community and many important papers are discussed in the review which is in general well-written. However, typos and grammar mistakes are found throughout the review which need to be corrected. Some of them are highlighted in the comments below. Furthermore, some important literature revealing different aspects of MIP-based chiral separation of drugs need to be included as they are currently missing. A deeper, comparative analysis of the processed literature is needed to improve the quality of the review (recommendation are given below).  I recommend major revision of the review.	{"296, 389, CONTENT","135, 142, TRIGGER","144, 170, CONTENT","441, 499, CONTENT","503, 509, ACTION","432, 439, ACTION","615, 622, LOCATION","401, 409, ACTION","390, 394, MODAL","209, 214, MODAL","4, 10, LOCATION","220, 229, ACTION","175, 181, ACTION","196, 203, LOCATION","283, 295, TRIGGER"}

7148	1.      The main value of the study would be properly conducted  validation of the CSSQP, but in practice, Authors presented no results of the validation. The properly conducted validation procedure requires to assess the results of both validity of the questionnaire (in comparison with other tool) and reproducibility of the tool (while it is applied at least twice), while Authors conduct none of them. The“validation” that Authors presented (that is not the validation of the questionnaire, in spite of the fact, that Authors called it so) is rather some descriptive statistics of obtained results, but with no comparison with other method and with no test-retest trial.	{"370, 375, TRIGGER","90, 93, TRIGGER","139, 153, CONTENT","304, 368, CONTENT","384, 396, ACTION","155, 198, CONTENT","612, 625, ACTION","64, 88, CONTENT","626, 674, CONTENT","54, 63, ACTION","36, 41, MODAL","8, 35, CONTENT","115, 138, ACTION","208, 217, ACTION","219, 299, CONTENT","300, 303, TRIGGER","199, 207, ACTION","409, 421, LOCATION","603, 606, TRIGGER","547, 553, TRIGGER"}
7149	In order to correct the study, Authors should conduct some further analysis – they should in their group of respondents try to collect once again the same CSSQP forms (in order to assess reproducibility) and any other forms commonly applied to assess the colonoscopy satisfaction (in order to assess validity). There is a number of such possibilities, as a number of very simple tools is already used in practice to assess the colonoscopy satisfaction.	{"150, 166, CONTENT","208, 280, CONTENT","180, 202, ACTION","204, 207, TRIGGER","46, 53, ACTION","83, 89, MODAL","53, 76, CONTENT","127, 134, ACTION","293, 308, ACTION","39, 45, MODAL"}

[2009] entitled“Patient satisfaction with colonoscopy: A literature review and pilot study” (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2694655/). The indicated study is very important in the field (but not referred by Authors in the presented manuscript) as it presents a number of possibilities of assessing the colonoscopy satisfaction (1-question tools, e.g. 5-point and 7-point Likert scale, visual analogue scale, the satisfaction/ preference assessment, with the questions such as“How satisfied were you with the procedure overall?”,“If it were advised by your doctor, how willing would you be to undergo this test again?”).	{"293, 317, LOCATION","23, 209, CONTENT","262, 265, TRIGGER","15, 22, ACTION","8, 14, MODAL","266, 278, ACTION"}
7151	If Authors do not want to use, as a reference method, the indicated instruments that are dedicated for the colonoscopy satisfaction assessment, they may use as a reference method some general medical patient satisfaction questionnaires, as there is also a number of such questionnaires.

7189	4. The authors should discuss the reproducibility of the preparation of the NPs as well as the adsorption experiments. Error bars / standard deviations should be presented when possible. Section 3.6 is useful but solutions to avoid the decreasing performance should be made based  on the literature. Could a carefully selected regeneration method avoid this problem?	{"209, 212, TRIGGER","187, 198, LOCATION","22, 30, ACTION","30, 118, CONTENT","162, 171, ACTION","152, 158, MODAL","326, 365, CONTENT","318, 326, ACTION","300, 305, MODAL","202, 208, ACTION","268, 273, ACTION","15, 21, MODAL","259, 265, MODAL","118, 151, CONTENT","213, 258, CONTENT"}

7191	6. The authors mention that magnetic NPs are green but did not elaborate on it. Given the global trend toward sustainable solutions, the greenness/sustainability of the presented methodology should be emphasized . Examples for sustainable adsorption including materials and process perspectives should be given in the introduction: Green Chem., 2017, 19, 3116-3125; Waste Management, 2011, 31, 1350-1356; Green Chem., 2015, 17, 5196-5205.	{"305, 310, ACTION","295, 301, MODAL","214, 294, CONTENT","332, 438, CONTENT","191, 197, MODAL","80, 190, CONTENT","201, 211, ACTION","59, 72, ACTION","51, 54, TRIGGER","76, 78, CONTENT","28, 50, CONTENT","314, 330, LOCATION"}
7193	8. In Figure 1,“reflect” should be“reflux”? Furthermore, the solvent and temperature should be written on each arrow in the reaction scheme. The sentence in line 113 should be deleted as there is no need  to mention what was not done in the work.	{"141, 153, LOCATION","176, 183, ACTION","166, 172, MODAL","157, 165, LOCATION","120, 139, LOCATION","103, 116, CONTENT","95, 102, ACTION","84, 91, MODAL","57, 84, CONTENT","44, 55, TRIGGER","34, 42, CONTENT","25, 31, MODAL","15, 24, LOCATION","6, 14, LOCATION"}
7194	9. The novelty of the work should be clearly stated  at the beginning of the manuscript. Applying aqueous media instead of organic solvents comes across as the main point. However, there are some literature reporting NPs synthesized in water. These should be mentioned and the current work should be compared  to them.	{"181, 241, CONTENT","89, 111, CONTENT","112, 122, ACTION","53, 87, LOCATION","45, 51, ACTION","27, 33, MODAL","3, 26, CONTENT","123, 170, CONTENT","172, 179, TRIGGER","249, 255, MODAL","259, 268, ACTION","273, 289, CONTENT","290, 296, MODAL","300, 309, ACTION"}
7195	10. In line 63 the argument against organic solvents is finished. At the end of this paragraph, the authors should mention that if the organic solvent cannot be avoided  then they should be recycled /recovered to improve the sustainability (although they add to the complexity of the process), and give broad examples for sustainable recovery processes from the literature: Desalination, 2003, 157, 87-95; ChemSusChem, 2017, 10, 3435-3444; J.

7196	11. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms were performed at relatively high concentrations. What is the actual concentration of Mercury in the environment and how does that relate to the tested concentrations? These questions should be discussed in the manuscript and the concentration range should be justified .	{"179, 208, CONTENT","173, 179, ACTION","302, 311, ACTION","159, 162, TRIGGER","100, 155, CONTENT","92, 96, TRIGGER","292, 298, MODAL","268, 291, CONTENT","47, 56, ACTION","249, 263, LOCATION","4, 41, CONTENT","236, 245, ACTION","226, 232, MODAL","209, 225, CONTENT"}
7197	The manuscript entitled“The Role of Vitamin D in Fertility and during Pregnancy and Lactation: A Review of Clinical Data” presents interesting issue but some major corrections are necessary.	{"149, 152, TRIGGER","180, 189, ACTION","23, 122, LOCATION","153, 175, CONTENT","0, 14, LOCATION"}
7200	The fact, that Authors conducted any study associated with vitamin D does not mean, that it should be included into the review associated  with the role of this nutrient in fertility/ pregnancy/ lactation. As the own studies of Authors can not be found in Pubmed while using the indicated  keywords (including: fertility, pregnancy, lactation, breastfeeding, breast milk), they should not be included  into the review about it.	{"145, 205, CONTENT","23, 82, CONTENT","102, 110, ACTION","205, 371, CONTENT","116, 126, LOCATION","378, 384, MODAL","407, 417, LOCATION","92, 98, MODAL","391, 400, ACTION"}
7202	Authors should present the number of publications that were found using  the indicated keywords, number of excluded ones (with the specified reasons of exclusion), number of additional references included on the basis of the analysis of the references of found studies (but only if associated with the aim of the study!), etc. The flowchart is recommended to obtain the better clarity.	{"327, 340, LOCATION","8, 14, MODAL","22, 326, CONTENT","14, 22, ACTION","359, 384, CONTENT","344, 355, ACTION"}
7203	Moreover, the other important issue is associated with the fact, that Author Contributions seems controversial and indicate the potential Guest Authorship procedure, which is forbidden. While there are 10 co-authors of the manuscript, in fact only one of them prepared the manuscript. SP was responsible for (1) conceptualization, (2) methodology, (3) data curation (by the way – what“data curation”, if there was no specific data gathered and only a review was prepared?), and (4) writing an original manuscript. The rest of Authors (9 of them!) edited the prepared manuscript and supervised SP. If they not participated in the manuscript preparation, they should be not indicated  as authors, but SP may thank them in the Acknowledgements Section, if needed. If they really participated, their role should be specified .	{"753, 759, ACTION","186, 191, TRIGGER","202, 215, CONTENT","218, 233, LOCATION","243, 259, CONTENT","260, 268, ACTION","268, 284, LOCATION","285, 287, LOCATION","292, 303, ACTION","308, 513, CONTENT","514, 546, CONTENT","547, 553, ACTION","582, 592, ACTION","593, 595, LOCATION","668, 681, ACTION","658, 664, MODAL","682, 693, CONTENT","699, 701, LOCATION","702, 706, MODAL","706, 711, ACTION","720, 748, CONTENT","801, 807, MODAL","811, 820, ACTION","553, 577, LOCATION","0, 8, TRIGGER","166, 171, TRIGGER","70, 90, LOCATION","174, 184, ACTION","91, 96, ACTION","597, 599, TRIGGER","96, 110, CONTENT","115, 123, ACTION","600, 651, CONTENT","761, 763, TRIGGER","763, 788, CONTENT","123, 164, CONTENT","790, 800, CONTENT","750, 752, TRIGGER"}
7204	The manuscript describes the synthesis and adsorption performance of Bisphenol A and progesterone selective imprinted polymers. The parameters of polymer preparation were designed and studied using Design of Experiment and MODDE software. The produced molecularly imprinted polymers were studied regarding the adsorption capacity, isotherms and kinetics. The original aim of the article is interesting and relevant, however there are mistakes and inconsistencies throughout the manuscript that must be addressed  prior to further consideration for publishing.	{"0, 14, LOCATION","416, 423, TRIGGER","502, 511, ACTION","474, 488, LOCATION","494, 498, MODAL","424, 462, CONTENT"}
7205	1) The authors set their aim in the last paragraph of the Introduction as the followings:“to unify the procedure of the synthesis of MIPs by the optimisation of different parameters during the polymerisation” and“to contribute to the detection and separation of different compounds from complex samples”. However, it is not clear how these goals was realized.	{"54, 70, LOCATION","330, 358, CONTENT","305, 312, TRIGGER","320, 329, ACTION","89, 303, LOCATION","32, 50, LOCATION"}
7206	2) The application of the produced MIPs for the detection of trace amount of EDs from real samples should be performed to prove their applicability in the proposed  field.	{"122, 127, ACTION","128, 147, CONTENT","109, 118, ACTION","98, 105, MODAL","3, 98, CONTENT"}
7208	4) The authors should briefly discuss the literature on the application of Modde/DoE in analytical chemistry with examples: Drug Test. Anal., 2014, 6, 898-908; Metabolomics, 2016, 12, 183; J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal., 2012, 70, 251-258).	{"38, 233, CONTENT","15, 21, MODAL","30, 37, ACTION"}

7210	6) There are a series of typos, small mistakes and grammatical errors in the manuscript. It should be revised and corrected  carefully. For example:	{"73, 87, LOCATION","114, 123, ACTION","3, 69, CONTENT","92, 98, MODAL","102, 109, ACTION"}
7211	Line 42:“revers” ->“rivers”	{"8, 16, LOCATION","0, 7, LOCATION","19, 27, CONTENT"}

7216	Line 261:“Figure 6”->“Figure 5”	{"9, 19, LOCATION","21, 31, CONTENT","0, 8, LOCATION"}
7217	7) The retention capacity has little meaning in itself it can be only interpreted  knowing the experimental conditions. The MIP loading and the original concentration should be indicated when retention capacities are presented . E.g.: Line 25 Introduction, Figure 4 caption and Figure 5 caption.	{"120, 166, CONTENT","235, 242, LOCATION","177, 186, ACTION","243, 255, LOCATION","257, 273, LOCATION","167, 173, MODAL","278, 294, LOCATION","187, 191, TRIGGER","192, 226, CONTENT"}
7218	8) The first two paragraphs of the introduction describe the health effects of endocrine disruptors in details. This part is unnecessarily extensive for a manuscript in analytical and polymer science. This should be shortened  down to 4-5 sentences and 2-3 references.	{"31, 47, LOCATION","216, 231, ACTION","206, 212, MODAL","3, 27, LOCATION","235, 267, CONTENT"}

7220	10) Calibration curves were obtained in a narrow concentration region (1-5 mg/L for BPA and 0.88 and 8.8 mg/L for PG). However, in the adsorption isotherm studies significantly higher concentrations were used (25-200 mg/L). How were these concentrations determined?	{"254, 264, ACTION","223, 227, TRIGGER","233, 253, CONTENT","4, 22, LOCATION","119, 126, TRIGGER"}

7223	13) The authors demonstrated reproducibility to a certain degree in the manuscript. As recently shown, the importance of careful selection of the eluent for imprinted polymers should be discussed  along with the results (Polym. Chem., 2017, 8, 666-673). It also needs to be clarified whether the“triplicate” data presented are based on independently prepared polymers, or using the same polymers three times.	{"103, 175, CONTENT","308, 407, CONTENT","186, 195, ACTION","295, 307, LOCATION","208, 219, LOCATION","220, 252, CONTENT","274, 283, ACTION","262, 267, MODAL","176, 182, MODAL"}

7227	The manuscript by Yin and co-workers provides insights into the preparation and properties of keratin-based membranes. The work is novel and a reasonable amount of reliable data is presented. The topic is of interest to both polymer chemists and materials scientists working in the field of bio-derived polymers and membranes. Nonetheless, there are several issues with the manuscript that must be thoroughly addressed  prior to further consideration for publishing in Polymers.	{"409, 418, ACTION","350, 364, CONTENT","370, 384, LOCATION","327, 338, TRIGGER","0, 14, LOCATION","390, 394, MODAL"}

7230	3. Waste feather, and the recovery of keratin from it, are introduced in the 1st paragraph of the introduction. In line 40 the authors should mention that the recovery of valuable chemicals from waste is a highly sought-after sustainable approach, and give recent examples: Green Chem. 2017, 19, 3116-3125; J. Environ. Chem. Eng. 2017, 5, 3051-3057.	{"142, 149, ACTION","135, 141, MODAL","115, 122, LOCATION","73, 90, LOCATION","155, 349, CONTENT","94, 110, LOCATION"}

7235	8. A short paragraph should be provided on a potential application of crosslinked  polymer membranes. Crosslinking is often used to fabricate solvent-resistant membranes for nanofiltration (ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 2018, 10, 16140-16147; J. Membr.

7244	In this manuscript, Gao and co-workers describe the preparation, characterisation and performance of bone char. A reasonable amount of experimental data were collected and presented in the manuscript. The research topic is timely and globally important. The work is novel and of interest to the broad readership of the journal. However, the article has several issues regarding the presentation of data, missing experiments, and setting the context and background for the research. The latter is currently limited and must be broadened  as per the comments below. Consequently, major revision is recommended to address the points below prior to further consideration for publishing in Applied Sciences.	{"540, 562, CONTENT","564, 577, TRIGGER","506, 513, ACTION","619, 635, CONTENT","525, 535, ACTION","482, 492, LOCATION","595, 607, ACTION","611, 618, ACTION","353, 481, CONTENT","578, 592, CONTENT","337, 348, LOCATION","518, 522, MODAL","327, 335, TRIGGER","3, 18, LOCATION"}

7246	2. The authors should comment on the reproducibility of their methods and results. Were independently prepared bone char samples used for the adsorption experiments? Standard deviations as error bars should be given on the graphs presenting  the adsorption and reusability data.

7248	4. As mentioned in line 43, bone char is a green/sustainable adsorbent. Given the importance and desired trend toward sustainable solutions, the authors should add a subsequent short paragraph on sustainable adsorption including  adsorbent and process focused examples: Green Chem., 2017, 19, 3116-3125; Waste Management, 2011, 31, 1350-1356.	{"6, 15, ACTION","160, 163, ACTION","19, 26, LOCATION","28, 70, CONTENT","164, 342, CONTENT","153, 159, MODAL"}

7259	The manuscript by Petrella and co-workers details the preparation, application and reuse of glass waste for water treatment. The topic is relevant to both academics and industrial professionals, and it is of interest to the journal’s readers, and fits well the scope of the journal. However, there are several issues that should be addressed  prior to further consideration by Materials.	{"0, 14, LOCATION","283, 290, TRIGGER","302, 316, CONTENT","322, 328, MODAL","332, 341, ACTION"}

7262	3) To follow up on the previous comment, the accuracy of the methods should be taken into account. Sample preparation and the experimental protocol for the adsorption are crucial. Significant digits should be considered , e.g. 0.01 decimal places seem to be inappropriate.	{"68, 75, MODAL","180, 198, CONTENT","99, 166, CONTENT","171, 178, ACTION","222, 271, CONTENT","199, 205, MODAL","41, 68, CONTENT","209, 219, ACTION","79, 84, ACTION"}
7263	4) The authors should comment on the safety aspects, i.e. lead leaching, during the proposed saturated waste reuse as thermal insulator and mortars.	{"30, 148, CONTENT","22, 29, ACTION","15, 21, MODAL"}

7273	15) The conclusion section should include the main research findings in quantitative statements, and on the contrary the abstract should not have quantitative data showing  the actual results. The conclusion section should be written up as a paragraph(s) rather than bullet points.	{"33, 41, ACTION","43, 95, CONTENT","117, 129, LOCATION","130, 140, MODAL","164, 171, ACTION","146, 163, CONTENT","27, 33, MODAL","4, 26, LOCATION","173, 191, CONTENT","97, 100, TRIGGER","193, 215, LOCATION","216, 222, MODAL","226, 233, ACTION","240, 280, CONTENT"}

7306	8.      In the case of the scientific manuscript, Authors should present the graphical material only if it is needed and it presents some information for readers. It is not a column of a newspaper and illustrations presenting photograph of hamburger and dry salami are unnecessary. Especially in the case of a review article, when Authors did not analyse the specific products, the question arises why Authors decided to present the specific products.	{"429, 450, CONTENT","64, 72, ACTION","73, 116, CONTENT","420, 428, ACTION","398, 401, TRIGGER","133, 161, CONTENT","124, 132, ACTION","58, 64, MODAL"}

It is especially important in the case of Na, as the general intake in both developing and developed countries (for America, Europe and Asia) is higher than the recommended level. As a result, Authors can not indicate that seaweeds are valuable in human nutrition, inter alia due to Na content, as it is not a value, but the main weakness of including seaweeds to diet. This approach is presented by Authors in many parts of the study and it should be in the whole study corrected .	{"573, 586, CONTENT","14, 18, MODAL","19, 26, ACTION","523, 572, CONTENT","520, 523, TRIGGER","426, 466, CONTENT","139, 201, CONTENT","136, 139, TRIGGER","54, 134, CONTENT","404, 411, MODAL","411, 420, ACTION","645, 651, MODAL","674, 683, ACTION","658, 673, LOCATION","26, 52, CONTENT","614, 637, LOCATION"}
7327	Especially for the supposition, that seaweeds may be a good salt replacers, enabling the reduced use of NaCl, to balance Na/K ratio (chapter 4.1-4.2), Authors must take into account the contribution of algae to RDA. As the presented algae (table 2) contribute to the 8-34% RDA value for Na but only 1-23% RDA value for K (while 9 algae in table 2 are characterized by the higher contribution of Na and only 3 – by higher contribution of K), they does not balance Na/K ratio. In the general western diet, there is too much Na, but not enough K, so adding more Na and less K does not balance the ratio but the influence on the ratio is negative.	{"339, 346, LOCATION","168, 214, CONTENT","164, 168, ACTION","159, 163, MODAL","133, 148, LOCATION","599, 603, TRIGGER","240, 247, LOCATION"}

7331	The manuscript by Shareefdeen details the design of biofilters for wastewater treatment. The topic is of interest to both professionals and academics working in the fields of filtration, water treatment and optimization. The work fits well the scope of the journal, however the novelty needs to be clarified. There are several issues that must be addressed  prior to further consideration by Processes. The manuscript needs to be reconsidered after having carefully addressed the comments listed below:	{"274, 285, CONTENT","418, 423, MODAL","266, 273, TRIGGER","0, 14, LOCATION","442, 501, CONTENT","403, 417, LOCATION","346, 356, ACTION","339, 343, MODAL","430, 442, ACTION","309, 333, CONTENT","298, 307, ACTION","286, 291, MODAL"}
7332	1) The abstract has one single line about the actual content of the article. The rest is a general introduction to the topic in broad sense. The emphasis should be vice versa.

7333	2) The introduction is wordy but not information-rich, rather too specialized; it should introduce trends and place the context of the work in a wider perspective. See also suggestions in other comments.	{"82, 88, MODAL","89, 98, ACTION","3, 19, LOCATION","98, 162, CONTENT"}
7334	3) The optimization of biofilters should be mentioned  in the introduction: Water Quality Research Journal, 2017, wqrjc2017012; Res.J.chem.sci., 2917, 7(8), 26-36.	{"58, 74, LOCATION","3, 34, CONTENT","44, 53, ACTION","34, 40, MODAL","76, 162, CONTENT"}

7337	6) The author mentions the advantages of biofilters over conventional H2S removal technologies. It should be explicitly mentioned  that biofilters provide a more sustainable wastewater treatment solution than the conventional techniques. The increasing demand and trend for sustainable wastewater treatment should be exemplified  in the discussion: Green Chem. 2015, 17, 5196-5205; Energy Environ.

7347	In this article, Selenite reductase CsrF overexpressed Escherichia coli was used as microbial factory to produce Se(0) nanoparticles (Bio-SeNPs). The research shows novelty in the field of adsorption removal of dyes by Bio-SeNPs. A large amount of experimental data were collected and presented in the article. The manuscript is well-written and has a clear thread. However, there are some mistakes and errors, which must be corrected  prior to further consideration for publication.	{"425, 434, ACTION","366, 373, TRIGGER","311, 325, LOCATION","375, 409, CONTENT","8, 15, LOCATION","417, 421, MODAL"}

7399	Authors should precisely present the obtained results, in order to be in agreement with what was in fact studied. Some sentences are misleading – e.g. “Induction of UC in rats increased TNF-α, IL-6, ESR, and MPO levels” suggests that Authors compared baseline results (before experiment) with the results after the study, while in fact they compared various groups after the study, so the sentence should be formulated  as “after the experiment, group X was characterized by higher NF-α, IL-6, ESR, and MPO levels, than group Y”. Such problems should be corrected  in whole study. Authors should discuss the obtained results while referring  the relevant publications conducted in a UC patients – if Authors specify spirulina as a source of carotenoids, including zeaxanthine, they should refer such studies which indicate the effect of zeaxanthine in UC (there are a number of such studies) Authors should use the vocabulary applied in nutritional sciences – e.g. There is no such category of food products as “healthy food” – I suppose that Authors may mean functional foods – do they? Authors should use more scientific language – it should be corrected  in the whole manuscript (e.g. “Inflammatory bowel disease (…) lacks a definitive cure”, “Inflammatory bowel disease (…) is characterised by (…) poor prognosis” – more specific information are needed).

7480	The main problem is associated with the fact, that the validation procedure requires the specific method of statistical analysis, that was not applied in the presented study.

7481	It seems that Authors are not native English speakers, as some sentences are hard to follow – I think that the article should be corrected  by a fluent English speaker (e.g. instead of“the study was taken to extract banana juice”, there should be“The aim of the study was to analyse the process of banana juice extraction”, etc.).	{"129, 138, ACTION","237, 243, MODAL","246, 322, CONTENT","58, 91, CONTENT","184, 229, LOCATION","119, 125, MODAL","174, 184, TRIGGER"}

7497	Results and discussion:	{"0, 22, LOCATION"}
7498	Table 1 should be presented  in Materials and methods section, as it is mentioned in this section and presenting it once again in Results and discussion section is redundant.	{"8, 14, MODAL","130, 160, LOCATION","160, 173, ACTION","85, 97, LOCATION","32, 61, LOCATION","18, 27, ACTION","0, 7, LOCATION","102, 126, CONTENT"}
7499	Authors assumed, that a three-dimensional model (analysed factor versus two independent variables) is suitable for their analysis, but they did not justify such approach. It is hard to guess why they applied such approach if in reality all the analysed variables (temperature of incubation, incubation time, cellulose concentration, pectinase concentration) may interact and influence the factor combined (not only in pairs that were analysed in the presented study).	{"131, 134, TRIGGER","156, 169, CONTENT","190, 194, TRIGGER","195, 467, CONTENT","140, 155, ACTION"}
7500	Authors presented excessive figures but with weak explanation why such model was applied – in my opinion, they should rather present a lower number of them, but they must justify the model and describe the obtained results in the context of the future application of observed data.	{"156, 161, TRIGGER","171, 178, ACTION","179, 188, CONTENT","193, 201, ACTION","28, 35, LOCATION","201, 281, CONTENT","35, 39, TRIGGER","111, 117, MODAL","125, 132, ACTION","135, 155, CONTENT","166, 170, MODAL"}
7501	There is not enough discussion in this section.	{"6, 19, ACTION","34, 46, LOCATION","20, 30, CONTENT"}
7502	The limitations section is necessary – Authors should include the limitations section as a separate paragraph in the Discussion section and present the limitations of their study, associated both with the conducted experiment (e.g. number of batches, repetitions), and with concluding (e.g. were there any interrupting factors, that may have influenced the observed results?).	{"140, 148, ACTION","148, 376, CONTENT","47, 53, MODAL","24, 36, ACTION","0, 23, CONTENT","62, 109, CONTENT","53, 61, ACTION","117, 135, LOCATION"}
7503	In the submitted manuscript, the authors studied the adsorptive properties of poly(1-methylpyrrol-2-ylsquaraine) (PMPS) particles for the separation of endocrine disrupting chemicals EDCs from aqueous solution in batch and fixed column configurations. The topic is important and timely. The experimental adsorption data were discussed and compared to the data reported in literature for activated carbon adsorbent. However, the novelty is unclear, and there are several issues that needs to be addressed prior to further consideration to be published in Processes.	{"482, 488, MODAL","494, 503, ACTION","462, 476, CONTENT","17, 27, LOCATION","415, 422, TRIGGER"}
7504	1. The novelty is unclear. The novelty should be clearly stated  in the manuscript. The novelty should be introduced  in relation to what has already been done in the literature, e.g. Adv. Appl.

7505	2. The manuscript needs to be seriously proofread. The editing/writing needs revising since there are a lot of typos, incorrect numbering, vague expressions and grammar mistakes. The authors tend to use filler words a lot which impacted the comprehension of the manuscript.	{"40, 49, ACTION","102, 177, CONTENT","6, 17, LOCATION","17, 23, MODAL","55, 70, CONTENT","71, 76, MODAL","77, 85, ACTION"}

7507	4. In the materials and methods section, the protocol of preparing the PMPS particles needs to be explained in details with clear schematic figures. Also, there is conflicting information mentioned in the section about the source of PMPS particles whether they were purchased from Exilica or prepared by the authors as claimed.	{"86, 91, MODAL","98, 107, ACTION","45, 85, CONTENT","10, 39, LOCATION","205, 212, LOCATION","212, 327, CONTENT","164, 187, CONTENT","188, 197, ACTION","108, 147, CONTENT"}
7508	5. The physical characteristics of PMPS particles are critical in evaluating their adsorption properties. The authors should measure and include important features such as the adsorbent surface area and average pore diameter to complement Table 1, which currently has only few general properties.	{"125, 132, ACTION","137, 144, ACTION","145, 224, CONTENT","239, 246, LOCATION","118, 124, MODAL"}

7514	12. “With the increase in flow rate there was a decrease in the empty bed contact time (EBCT), while the height of the mass transfer zone increased. At lower flow rate EE2 had more contact time with the PMPS particles, hence the lower EBCT” There seems to be a confusion here, since this sentence can interpreted in a way that the flow rate of adsorbate has no effect on the EBCT, if that is correct, how was EBCT decreased when the MTZ increased?	{"4, 240, LOCATION","301, 312, ACTION","283, 296, LOCATION","260, 270, ACTION","405, 446, CONTENT","297, 300, MODAL","312, 379, CONTENT","401, 404, MODAL","381, 383, TRIGGER","247, 252, MODAL"}
7516	14. Continuous processing is the way forward and the authors should stress that in the manuscript. The potential of the column process the authors developed in continuous processing should be evaluated .

For a Table 1 – they may try to divide table into 2 smaller ones (with changing orientation into vertical one) – with country, aim (shortened), study outline, analysis method (shortened) in the 1st table and type of method, health benefit analyzed, population and confirmation in the 2nd table.

It is absolutely not clear what the new findings are in this manuscript, and what has been already observed before. For instance, in line 166 the authors give a measured value of 45 but then provide a reference. Is this measured by the authors or found in the literature cited? The manuscript needs to be carefully revised to avoid these mistakes and ambiguities.

7679	There is a really major problem associated with the risk of “guest authorship” procedure which is forbidden. Based on the information presented in this section there is the following problem: YCW – he did not participate in manuscript preparation at all – he should be indicated  rather in Acknowledgements Section	{"224, 253, CONTENT","256, 259, CONTENT","122, 143, CONTENT","147, 159, LOCATION","192, 196, CONTENT","201, 220, ACTION","109, 117, TRIGGER","259, 266, MODAL","269, 278, ACTION","290, 314, LOCATION","166, 190, ACTION"}
7680	The manuscript by Palumbo et al. is of interest to the membrane community but there are major issues that need improvement or clarification before acceptance for publication in Membranes.	{"126, 140, ACTION","88, 100, CONTENT","106, 111, MODAL","111, 123, ACTION","74, 77, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION"}
7681	1) The abstract is somewhat short and vague. Specify what‘ultrapure grade’ actually means. Quantify the statements‘deeply modifies’ and‘strong reduction’ as these informal expressions do not suffice a research article. More of these vague expressions occur at later stages of the article, e.g.“exceptional fast kinetics”.	{"157, 183, CONTENT","293, 320, LOCATION","104, 114, CONTENT","53, 57, TRIGGER","201, 217, CONTENT","7, 16, LOCATION","28, 33, ACTION","38, 43, ACTION","57, 74, LOCATION","45, 53, ACTION","91, 100, ACTION","114, 131, LOCATION","135, 153, LOCATION","184, 198, ACTION","219, 250, CONTENT","251, 257, ACTION"}
7682	2) Avoid bulk referencing, e.g. in line 33 the references [1-6] should be replaced  with a review on the topic such as Chem. Rev., 2007, 107 (10), pp 4078–4110; and/or Journal of Colloid and Interface Science 314 (2007) 589–603.	{"9, 25, CONTENT","3, 9, ACTION","91, 227, CONTENT","74, 84, ACTION","64, 71, MODAL","47, 63, LOCATION","35, 42, LOCATION"}
7683	3) The introduction briefly explains some of the previous works on metal based membranes for gas separation but it lacks any critical edge. The limitations/drawbacks of state-of-the-art prior literature should be mentioned, and linked to the current research by explaining how this new contribution by Palumbo et al. advances the field.	{"115, 120, ACTION","242, 338, CONTENT","203, 210, MODAL","125, 138, CONTENT","228, 235, ACTION","7, 20, LOCATION","144, 202, CONTENT","213, 222, ACTION","108, 112, TRIGGER"}
7684	4) The introduction should have a paragraph on polymer-based membranes for gas/hydrogen separation mentioning their potential (http://dx.doi.org/10.1557/mrs2006.187; Polymer, 2013, 54, 4729-4761; Polym. Chem. 2010, 1, 63-68) and also their limitations with regards to temperature stability, selectivity and undesirable wastewater generation during fabrication (Green Chem., 2015, 17, 5196-5205; Macromolecules, 2012, 45, 3298–3311).	{"27, 32, ACTION","20, 27, MODAL","7, 20, LOCATION","34, 434, CONTENT"}
7685	5) In Figure 1“Sample Temperature” is capitalised whilst“heat flow” isn’t. The space between the numbers and degreeC is missing. The consistency in formatting the article needs to be improved.	{"68, 73, ACTION","163, 170, LOCATION","56, 67, LOCATION","14, 34, LOCATION","6, 14, LOCATION","171, 177, MODAL","183, 191, ACTION","50, 56, TRIGGER","133, 158, CONTENT","117, 127, ACTION","79, 116, CONTENT","35, 49, ACTION"}
7686	6) The font size for the text in the inset of Figure 1 needs to be larger as it is barely legible.	{"37, 54, LOCATION","7, 29, CONTENT","55, 61, MODAL","67, 74, ACTION"}
7687	7) Section 2.1 is too short and contains only basic data interpretation without any in-depth analysis of the results. Why are these results important? What is the relevance of this data? What is the effect of the findings on the research? These questions need to be answered for both expert and non-expert readers to be able to follow the article. Without meaningful discussions on the results, the manuscript reads as a compilation of data.	{"118, 122, TRIGGER","3, 14, LOCATION","32, 45, ACTION","255, 260, MODAL","122, 149, CONTENT","156, 185, CONTENT","46, 116, CONTENT","192, 237, CONTENT","151, 156, TRIGGER","187, 192, TRIGGER","266, 275, ACTION","239, 254, CONTENT","15, 27, ACTION"}
7688	8) What is H/M value? It is currently not defined in the manuscript.	{"57, 67, LOCATION","3, 8, TRIGGER","8, 20, CONTENT","38, 49, ACTION"}
7689	9) Error bars and standard deviations are not given in the entire manuscript except Table 1. Have the experiments been repeated? Comments on the reproducibility of the results should be included  in the manuscript.	{"176, 183, MODAL","77, 84, TRIGGER","129, 175, CONTENT","186, 196, ACTION","84, 91, LOCATION","66, 77, LOCATION","203, 213, LOCATION","3, 37, CONTENT","93, 97, TRIGGER","98, 127, CONTENT","38, 51, ACTION"}
7690	11) The conclusion section of the paper has some critical edge but does not directly mention the novelty of the work in relation to the literature. The qualitative statements should be complemented  with some quantitative results in the conclusion section.	{"209, 229, CONTENT","185, 199, ACTION","34, 40, LOCATION","152, 174, CONTENT","97, 146, CONTENT","237, 255, LOCATION","67, 92, ACTION","63, 67, TRIGGER","8, 26, LOCATION","175, 182, MODAL"}
7691	12) The membrane preparation and hydrogen adsorption descriptions lack experimental details, and the suppliers of the materials/chemicals used are not mentioned. Consequently, the work is unreproducible. More technical details must be provided  in the experimental section.	{"235, 245, ACTION","252, 272, LOCATION","227, 232, MODAL","204, 226, CONTENT","180, 185, CONTENT","101, 142, CONTENT","71, 91, CONTENT","66, 71, ACTION","162, 174, TRIGGER","4, 65, CONTENT","143, 160, ACTION","185, 202, ACTION"}
7692	The authors adequately addressed most of the comments, and the manuscript significantly improved. However, there are several outstanding issues that needs to be addressed prior to further consideration for publishing:	{"117, 143, CONTENT","98, 105, TRIGGER","161, 171, ACTION","149, 155, MODAL"}
7693	1. The authors should comment on the reproducibility of the emulsion preparation and the characterisation techniques. The authors replied that all experiments were repeated 2–4 times. Consequently, standard deviations should be shown in the figures and tables. The captions should have a sentence about the derivation of the error bars.	{"274, 281, MODAL","265, 274, LOCATION","253, 259, LOCATION","241, 249, LOCATION","22, 30, ACTION","228, 234, ACTION","218, 225, MODAL","198, 217, CONTENT","37, 116, CONTENT","15, 22, MODAL","288, 335, CONTENT","281, 286, ACTION"}
7694	2. The figure captions should be more informative (e.g. Figure 4). Some of them are as short as a few words. The figures ad tables should stand on their own to facilitate understanding  the manuscript.	{"30, 49, ACTION","157, 200, CONTENT","55, 64, LOCATION","131, 138, MODAL","138, 156, ACTION","23, 30, MODAL","124, 131, LOCATION","113, 121, LOCATION","7, 22, LOCATION"}
7695	3. The text in all figures should have the same font size.	{"15, 26, LOCATION","7, 12, CONTENT","42, 57, CONTENT","34, 39, ACTION","27, 34, MODAL"}
7696	4. The introduction should contain a short paragraph on the need for sustainable development. The general discussion about the trend toward sustainable development should include broad examples, to stress that sustainable solutions are needed throughout various industrial sectors: e-waste (ACS Sustainable Chem. Eng., 2018, 6, 6507-6517), natural product extraction (Green Chem., 2017, 19, 3116-3125), oil production (Green Chem., 2017, 19, 1462-1489), solvent recovery (J. Membr. Sci., 2016, 514, 646-658), pharmaceutical manufacturing (ChemSusChem, 2017, 10, 3435-3444); and the present manuscript contributes to the sustainability efforts focusing on fuel efficiency.	{"27, 35, ACTION","20, 27, MODAL","7, 20, LOCATION","164, 171, MODAL","37, 92, CONTENT","590, 601, LOCATION","179, 572, CONTENT","171, 179, ACTION","94, 163, CONTENT"}
7697	5. The authors should include the TGA thermograms for the silica content of ESBR/silica WMB in a Supporting Information file, instead of the main article.	{"22, 30, ACTION","126, 136, TRIGGER","15, 22, MODAL","97, 124, LOCATION","34, 91, CONTENT","141, 153, LOCATION"}
7698	6. Add tick marks on the x-axis of Figure 4 for better navigation.	{"7, 17, CONTENT","3, 7, ACTION","25, 43, LOCATION"}
7699	7. The main research outcomes should be summarized  in some quantitative statement in the Conclusions section.	{"7, 29, CONTENT","52, 82, CONTENT","90, 109, LOCATION","40, 52, ACTION","30, 37, MODAL"}
7700	The article presents an important study of micronutrient status among pregnant women in Niger. It is a very interesting manuscript, presenting very good, properly planned study, but with relatively poor discussion section, that needs to be polished. Also in the materials and methods section some issues must be explained and some other minor corrections are required .	{"178, 181, TRIGGER","203, 221, LOCATION","228, 234, MODAL","326, 354, CONTENT","359, 368, ACTION","240, 248, ACTION","262, 291, LOCATION","292, 303, CONTENT","187, 202, ACTION","312, 322, ACTION","304, 309, MODAL","4, 11, LOCATION","120, 130, LOCATION"}
7701	The discussion section is relatively the weakest part of the study, because there are not enough elements of the discussion in the discussion. Authors present in many cases just repetition of results but without any references to literature. I understand, that in many cases there are no such references published, but they should try to find the other way to discuss them, e.g. they may try to indicate the possible reasons or consequences of observed situation.	{"395, 403, ACTION","23, 53, ACTION","151, 158, ACTION","338, 342, ACTION","82, 96, ACTION","97, 123, CONTENT","131, 141, LOCATION","173, 199, CONTENT","4, 22, LOCATION","408, 462, CONTENT","384, 388, MODAL","347, 372, CONTENT","324, 331, MODAL","315, 319, TRIGGER","204, 240, CONTENT","200, 203, TRIGGER","68, 76, TRIGGER"}
7702	While in the discussion section the issue of declared reducing intake during pregnancy is indicated also the possible reasons should be mentioned . Is it possible that it is just the subjective assessment? Or it is real reducing, resulting from the fact that the physical activity may be reduced  (reduced duties at home?)?	{"100, 105, TRIGGER","13, 31, LOCATION","154, 204, CONTENT","0, 5, TRIGGER","148, 154, TRIGGER","136, 146, ACTION","126, 133, MODAL","209, 322, CONTENT","206, 209, TRIGGER","109, 125, CONTENT","36, 99, CONTENT"}
7703	Taking into account the inclusion criteria, I think that some issues should be explained . It is not clearly presented if the week of pregnancy was in the exclusion criteria (i.e. was it possible that the woman at the end of her 3rd trimester would be enrolled  for the study?). Were there any other diseases (other than requiring immediate hospital referral and mental disability) that were in the exclusion criteria – e.g. diseases that cause lower micronutrients absorption, higher requirements (e.g. gastrointestinal diseases) or decreased immunity. If it was not taken into account, it should be analysed  in results section (how it disturbed results) or commented in the discussion section (how it could have disturbed the results).	{"279, 289, TRIGGER","696, 737, CONTENT","126, 173, CONTENT","290, 552, CONTENT","554, 557, TRIGGER","557, 586, CONTENT","591, 598, MODAL","119, 122, TRIGGER","601, 609, ACTION","660, 670, ACTION","79, 89, ACTION","614, 629, LOCATION","629, 656, CONTENT","69, 76, MODAL","180, 186, TRIGGER","187, 275, CONTENT","57, 68, CONTENT","677, 695, LOCATION","657, 660, TRIGGER","94, 118, ACTION"}
7704	Moreover, in the study participants section it is indicated, that women were excluded from blood collection, while their Hb was < 7 g/dl. It also should be commented , as a fact that may had influenced the results observed in the study.	{"0, 8, TRIGGER","156, 166, ACTION","173, 235, CONTENT","66, 136, CONTENT","17, 43, LOCATION","146, 153, MODAL"}
7705	In the results section not all data must be presented  in tables. Especially, taking into account, that some data are presented in tables and afterwards once again – presented in the text, Authors should consider reducing  the number of tables. Some data may be just presented  in the text of manuscript and in the supplementary material.	{"245, 254, CONTENT","197, 204, MODAL","66, 76, TRIGGER","315, 337, LOCATION","7, 22, LOCATION","267, 278, ACTION","36, 41, MODAL","78, 187, CONTENT","285, 303, LOCATION","44, 55, ACTION","255, 259, MODAL","58, 64, LOCATION","23, 35, CONTENT","204, 212, ACTION","213, 243, CONTENT"}
7706	While talking about high frequency of anemia, Authors should remember, that anemia is associated with poor status of some micronutrients, so indicating, that in the case of the pregnant anemic women their micronutrient status is unknown is some kind of simplification – it should be explained , that Authors think about complete analysis of micronutrients status.	{"295, 362, CONTENT","54, 61, MODAL","61, 69, ACTION","273, 280, MODAL","283, 293, ACTION","0, 6, TRIGGER","6, 44, CONTENT","71, 267, CONTENT"}

7708	Authors should properly present adequate background for their study – they should indicate what is the potential benefit of Moringa oleifera leaf and root powder with a specific benefit, not only the fact that it may be better than synthetic antioxidants (why exactly Moringa oleifera may be recommended , not other components?).	{"8, 14, MODAL","256, 260, TRIGGER","24, 32, ACTION","32, 67, CONTENT","82, 91, ACTION","103, 254, CONTENT","260, 326, CONTENT","75, 82, MODAL"}

7727	1. The abstract should have a single sentence to introduce the research motivation from a broad perspective.2. The introduction starts in medias res. The context of the work should be set first. What scientific problems and questions the work try to address?3. The scale bars on the SEM images should be visible. The resolution is too low to be able to see what length the scale bar actually represents.4. Reproducibility should be discussed . Were the catalysts prepared and tested several times? Standard deviations for the obtained data should be presented where possible, in particular Figures 9-10 where the CO conversion is presented.5. Closely related work on CO oxidation should be mentioned  in the introduction such as 10.3390/catal9030256; 10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.10.015; 10.1021/jacs.7b13624 (DOI).6. CO oxidation (in particular at low temperature) is pivotal to the abatement of exhaust gases and therefore ties in well with the increasingly important sustainability efforts in catalysis. A general paragraph on sustainability should be added  to the introduction. Briefly mention the different fields of sustainable solutions via catalysis such as biorefinery (10.1039/C8GC04017F), organocatalysis (10.1021/acscatal.8b01706), waste valorization (10.1039/C9GC00902G), hydrogen evolution (10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b05302), natural laterite (10.1021/acsanm.8b01117).7. The catalysts were washed with isopropanol. The amount expressed as “L solvent per kg catalyst” should be explicitly given under the experimental section. The scale of catalyst fabrication should also be revealed as currently the exact amounts are not disclosed under section 4.1.8. The recovery and reusability of the catalysts should be discussed  in the text. Have the authors performed any repeated experiments on used catalysts? Have they observed any performance decline? What are the criteria for reusing the catalysts? What is the expected lifetime of the catalysts?9. In order to minimize waste and address the sustainability requirements, the authors should mention that the isopropanol could be recycled  using sustainable membrane technologies (solvent recycling) and mention 10.1016/j.jcat.2019.01.041 example.10. The conclusion section should briefly mention the main limitations and drawbacks of the proposed catalysts, as well as the novelty of the presented work in relation to the existing literature.11.

Table 2 should be moved  to the Supporting Information, and the rationale for selecting its content (and omitting other similar works) should be explained .	{"246, 256, ACTION","353, 360, ACTION","480, 490, ACTION","470, 477, MODAL","399, 470, CONTENT","367, 389, LOCATION","343, 350, MODAL","335, 343, LOCATION","290, 333, CONTENT","276, 287, ACTION","266, 273, MODAL","259, 266, CONTENT","3, 8, TRIGGER","43, 98, LOCATION","196, 245, CONTENT","8, 39, CONTENT"}

7793	6. The photodegradation rate should be expressed as gram degraded  RhB over gram catalyst and unit time, e.g.“g g^-1 h^-1”, instead of % which is meaningless (Table 1).

7794	7. The manuscript starts in medias res. Instead, a brief paragraph should be added  on the recent trend toward sustainable catalysis and processing in general with broad examples to widen the context, e.g. agricultural waste treatment (Green Chem., 2017, 19, 3116-3125.), green biotechnology (Microb.

This will facilitate following and understanding  the manuscript. Moreover, the figure captions need to have individual text for each panel, e.g. Figure 3 has 5 panels, each panel need to be explained and referred to individually.	{"263, 293, CONTENT","300, 308, LOCATION","313, 321, CONTENT","69, 77, LOCATION","81, 89, ACTION","52, 62, ACTION","323, 333, LOCATION","359, 370, ACTION","334, 339, MODAL","93, 152, CONTENT","220, 228, TRIGGER","234, 249, LOCATION","8, 23, LOCATION","345, 355, ACTION","250, 255, MODAL","258, 263, ACTION","24, 50, ACTION"}
7800	14. The SEM images revealed the same morphology for all samples, therefore it is sufficient to show only one image as a typical example, i.e. delete panels b-f) in Figure 5, or move them to a Supporting Information.

7806	1) The authors admit that there is a large number of studies on SPP enhanced absorption of pattern graphene arrays “strips, rings, crosses and so on”). However, there is no discussion about the aspects how the performance of the absorber proposed in this work could be better or different from the other arrays. A larger emphasis should be put on explaining the novelty of the work and comparing  the results with the previous works in this field. Especially, given that no experimental work has been carried out.	{"448, 458, TRIGGER","152, 159, TRIGGER","115, 149, LOCATION","170, 310, CONTENT","314, 329, CONTENT","330, 337, MODAL","340, 344, ACTION","347, 446, CONTENT","460, 512, CONTENT"}

7897	2) The introduction of IPB is unnecessary and values such as 1358% does not make much sense.

7900	5) Imprinting is usually used in analytical chemistry for small-scale applications. The authors propose a purification/isolation process based on imprinted polymers. Similar works aiming at large scale application of imprinted polymers should be mentioned  in the introduction (e.g. Chapuis et al. J. Chromatogr. A, 2006, 1135, 127.; Green Chem., 2015, 17, 5196.; ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2015, 7, 9516.; Appl. Microbiol.

7902	7) Reference 26 is wrong. The authors claim that MNSs are the most popular substrates for core-shell MIPs. Reference 26 is a single research article on the topic and consequently it is not possible to generalize. If it is indeed the most popular substrate than it should be backed  up with a proper review/book reference, or simply remove the statement.	{"339, 352, CONTENT","274, 284, ACTION","264, 270, MODAL","16, 24, ACTION","3, 15, LOCATION","332, 338, ACTION","292, 320, CONTENT"}
7903	8) Only dopamine was used as functional monomer and it was not“diluted” with any crosslinker. The template to functional monomer ratio for the synthesis should be explicitly mentioned . It seems that the functional monomer was used in a large excess which is undesired for molecular imprinting as it promotes the formation of non-specific binding sites and ultimately lead to low selectivity.	{"174, 183, ACTION","94, 152, CONTENT","153, 159, MODAL"}
7904	9) What is the expected secondary interaction between the template and the functional monomer? A scheme on the complex would be useful to guide the readers.	{"3, 7, TRIGGER","125, 134, ACTION","119, 124, MODAL","95, 118, CONTENT","15, 94, CONTENT"}
7909	14) Line 174, elaborate more, it is not clear why the results support removal of the template.	{"14, 23, ACTION","4, 12, LOCATION","46, 93, CONTENT"}
7910	15) Informal expressions, such as “it’s believed” should be avoided  in the manuscript.	{"4, 24, CONTENT","50, 56, MODAL","60, 67, ACTION","34, 49, LOCATION","76, 86, LOCATION"}
7911	16) It is sufficient to show only two panels under Figure 2. The rest of the images can be removed .	{"91, 98, ACTION","51, 59, LOCATION","24, 28, ACTION","29, 44, CONTENT","61, 83, CONTENT"}
7912	17) Error bars and standard deviations are not given for any of the experiments. Have they been repeated? The plots should show the error bars where possible.	{"81, 85, TRIGGER","43, 52, ACTION","123, 127, ACTION","86, 104, CONTENT","110, 115, LOCATION","68, 79, LOCATION","116, 122, MODAL","4, 38, CONTENT","128, 157, CONTENT"}
7913	18) At the end of the manuscript some reproducibility data is shown. However, imprinted polymers are robust materials that can be reused  excessively, which should be mentioned  (Polym. Chem., 2017, 8, 666).	{"78, 149, CONTENT","167, 176, ACTION","69, 76, TRIGGER","11, 32, LOCATION","157, 163, MODAL"}
7914	19) The comments on scale-up and low cost in the conclusion section should be removed  as there is no evidence in the manuscript to support such claims.	{"49, 67, LOCATION","4, 41, CONTENT","68, 74, MODAL","78, 85, ACTION"}
7915	Although the manuscript is somewhat ambiguous, the results are new, and the topic is of interest to the readers of Sensors. Prior to further consideration for publication, the authors should carefully address the comments below.	{"201, 208, ACTION","184, 190, MODAL","209, 228, CONTENT"}
7920	5. Bulk referencing should be avoided , e.g. line 28, refs [1-14].

7937	4. In the introduction, the authors mention the advantages and need for novel nanocomposite materials. It should be mentioned in the manuscript that there is a need  for materials enabling sustainable separation processes (give example, Green Chem., 2017, 19, 3116-3125.), and the INT-WS2-PHBV nanocomposite is a potential candidate for such purposes.	{"133, 143, LOCATION","144, 351, CONTENT","106, 112, MODAL","116, 125, ACTION","10, 22, LOCATION"}

7942	9. A separate section on Mathematical Framework should be added  before the Results section, where all equations and definitions can be introduced  (i.e. move all equations into this section). This will aim smooth flow and better understanding  of the main text under the Results section, which is not broken up by the equations.	{"58, 63, ACTION","3, 47, CONTENT","99, 128, CONTENT","136, 146, ACTION","48, 54, MODAL","65, 91, LOCATION","178, 190, LOCATION","159, 172, CONTENT","154, 158, ACTION"}

7944	The manuscript entitled „Effects of Unfiltered Coffee and Bioactive Coffee Compounds on the Development of Metabolic Syndrome Components in a High?Fat/High?Fructose-Fed Rat Model” presents an interesting issue, but some important corrections are needed.	{"242, 252, ACTION","215, 241, CONTENT","24, 179, LOCATION"}
7945	As Authors compared groups, they should not use the words such as“increased”/“decreased” (as the observation of the same animals and changes in the function of time was not conducted), but instead they should use the words such as“was higher than”/“was lower than in the case of control group”.	{"40, 47, ACTION","185, 188, TRIGGER","202, 208, MODAL","65, 76, LOCATION","33, 39, MODAL","213, 294, CONTENT","209, 212, ACTION","77, 88, LOCATION"}

8017	- The differences among the types of CNT growth mechanisms showed in Figure 3 are ambiguous. It seems like there were four distinct mechanisms for CNT growth. However, the mechanism can be either VLS or VSS from the aspect of carbon atom’s state of matter and either tip-growth or base-growth depending on the position of the catalyst particle during the growth. Also, the difference between VLS and VSS mechanisms is difficult to illustrate properly in the presented way.	{"369, 414, CONTENT","78, 91, ACTION","69, 77, LOCATION","159, 166, TRIGGER","415, 441, ACTION"}

8048	In spite of a fact that Authors prepared not research but a review article, their Abstract must have its structure (justification – aim – results – conclusions), so Authors must precisely specify what was the aim of their review, what results did they observe in their literature search and what was their conclusion based on indicated results.	{"188, 195, ACTION","196, 344, CONTENT","82, 90, LOCATION"}
8049	In this section Authors should precisely justify the study – specify why they supposed that there is an association between vitamin D deficiency and insulin resistance.	{"69, 168, CONTENT","3, 15, LOCATION","41, 48, ACTION","49, 58, CONTENT","61, 68, ACTION","24, 30, MODAL"}
8050	Moreover, they should formulate the aim of the study.	{"15, 21, MODAL","0, 8, TRIGGER","22, 31, ACTION","32, 53, CONTENT"}
8054	The main problem is associated with the fact, that the study was planned and conducted for unknown number of batches, samples and repetitions, while for the plant material, due to very serious influence of the natural variability of the product, the multiple batches, samples and repetitions are necessary. In the study design it was indicated that the multiple batches were not assessed and number of samples/ repetitions also are not precisely indicated, so it seems that only one sample was assessed in repetitions. It must be clearly specified  in the Materials and methods section, as well as it must be discussed  as the limitation of the study.	{"556, 585, LOCATION","538, 547, ACTION","609, 618, ACTION","620, 650, CONTENT","353, 517, CONTENT"}
8055	Authors should clearly indicate, that some species/ cultivars were unknown. They should specify for which samples the characteristics is known and describe it, and for which it is unknown. The information, that“Olive oil from Spain was commercially available (Carrefour, France)” is not relevant – readers will not contact Carrefour in order to ask for the species/ cultivars – Authors should either do it (get the information from the distributor and present in the study) or just indicate, that it was commercially available oil and species/ cultivars are unknown.	{"96, 187, CONTENT","386, 392, MODAL","400, 405, ACTION","407, 472, CONTENT","482, 490, ACTION","492, 566, CONTENT","8, 14, MODAL","33, 74, CONTENT","23, 31, ACTION","280, 295, ACTION","210, 279, LOCATION","81, 87, MODAL","88, 95, ACTION"}
8056	While Authors planned to conduct comparison and present their data in tables, they must include also the statistical analysis of the data. While they did not include any statistical analysis – neither analysis of the normality of distribution, nor the comparison between results obtained for various oils, the conclusions are totally irrelevant. The observed results are for readers meaningless. The PCA analysis is not the properly conducted statistical analysis, as the data presented in tables are not analysed and not described properly. The only data that were statistically analysed are not presented in the manuscript, but as a supplementary file.	{"322, 344, ACTION","359, 366, LOCATION","400, 412, LOCATION","501, 513, ACTION","518, 531, ACTION","593, 606, ACTION","472, 476, CONTENT","551, 588, CONTENT","614, 624, LOCATION","635, 653, LOCATION","490, 496, LOCATION","88, 95, ACTION","101, 137, CONTENT","70, 76, LOCATION","310, 321, LOCATION","248, 304, CONTENT","201, 242, CONTENT","166, 190, CONTENT","150, 165, ACTION"}
8057	Moreover, Authors presented mean and SD values, while they did not verify previously the normality of distribution. In the case of some of the data, distributions seem to be different than normal (e.g. in the case of trolox).

8070	1) There is no report on the errors for the results presented in Figures 4 and 5.

Readers interested in the deepen analysis of the issues of sustainability are rather looking for articles interesting for them in“Sustainability” journal than in any other.

Taking into account, that not only patients, but also MDs are very interested in more“natural” therapeutical methods (such as diet modification or probiotics), the probiotic treatment should be incorporated  into review. Authors should indicate in their manuscript the studies indicating , that probiotics may alleviate syndroms of IBS (e.g. meta-analysis of Hoveyda et al. 2009 - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19220890) but at the same time, they must remember, that current data is insufficient to conclude undoubtedly about the possible influence of probiotics and they must indicate it in their article.	{"453, 465, ACTION","82, 106, CONTENT","728, 828, CONTENT","167, 213, CONTENT","838, 842, MODAL","218, 257, CONTENT","118, 124, LOCATION","145, 160, ACTION","423, 442, CONTENT","601, 684, CONTENT","488, 494, MODAL","495, 503, ACTION","513, 523, LOCATION","524, 594, CONTENT","718, 726, ACTION","864, 871, LOCATION","843, 851, ACTION","443, 449, MODAL","66, 81, ACTION","713, 717, MODAL","472, 478, LOCATION"}

However, these strategies are not explained in the article, and the acceptable levels are not discussed in the manuscript. In general the conclusions section is too short and vague needing more elaboration and quantitative discussions, e.g. what are the impurity levels and detection limits etc.	{"11, 22, LOCATION","401, 412, ACTION","432, 468, CONTENT","419, 424, TRIGGER","187, 203, CONTENT","65, 176, LOCATION","178, 185, TRIGGER","367, 383, ACTION","359, 366, MODAL","353, 358, ACTION","339, 348, ACTION","316, 335, LOCATION","229, 236, LOCATION","268, 281, ACTION","208, 221, ACTION","246, 263, CONTENT","289, 299, LOCATION"}
8123	The manuscript is a critical review on opportunities for the management of biosolids with a focus on pyrolysis and the possible application of the solid fraction of pyrolysis into soil amelioration. Pyrolysis of biosolids leads to several benefits, compared to the traditional landfilling, incineration or land application, e.g. destruction of pathogens, potential to recover energy and obtaining a solid product which can be used  as soil amendment. The manuscript reads well, however, there are mistakes and shortcomings which must be corrected  prior to further consideration for publication.	{"529, 534, MODAL","478, 485, TRIGGER","455, 466, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","497, 522, CONTENT","537, 548, ACTION"}

The main reason (the absence or availability of the racemic approach) should also be included in the text.	{"91, 98, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","334, 399, CONTENT","51, 69, LOCATION","312, 328, ACTION","100, 120, CONTENT","400, 407, MODAL","415, 424, ACTION","126, 307, LOCATION","431, 435, LOCATION"}

8245	10) Are there any results about reproducibility of the polymerisation procedure? Were the NP preparations duplicated or triplicated? Were the materials reused? Discussions on these points should be included when the results are presented . In particular, robustness of similar crosslinked polymers was demonstrated in the literature, pointing out the importance of the regeneration method (Polym.

8249	1.       The number of animals in a group is insufficient to conclude, as Authors had in their study 4 animals in each group. So based on such number of animals, they can not have reliable observations, due to a natural variability in animal models. Authors stated, that their“sample size was calculated on the basis of the mean on the daily amount of diet consumption” – it is rather impossible as they must have had the animals previously, before observing their intake.	{"404, 409, MODAL","45, 69, ACTION","180, 201, CONTENT","13, 41, CONTENT","276, 369, LOCATION","167, 179, ACTION","409, 417, ACTION","385, 395, ACTION","421, 471, CONTENT","378, 385, TRIGGER"}
8250	2.       The problem indicated by Authors is not justified and it seems to be trivial, as Authors compared diet with no vitamin D at all (0 IU), moderate amount of vitamin D (1400 IU/ kg) and high amount of vitamin D (4000 IU/ kg).

8288	The manuscript presents the results of the original study associated with validation of the folate-FFQ. It presents the results of properly planned and conducted research study. In my opinion, such studies and such questionnaires, as applied by researchers, are currently of a great value due to problems with satisfying folate needs in a groups of young women. However, some minor corrections should be made.	{"404, 408, ACTION","4, 15, LOCATION","362, 369, TRIGGER","376, 393, CONTENT","394, 401, MODAL"}
8289	Introduction - authors indicate the problem with folate deficiencies in Serbia as a country without folates fortification policy, but after reading the introduction, reader may jump to conclusions, that it is a problem observed exclusively in Serbia. In such situation, the article would not be interesting for international readers and should be published   rather in Serbian journal. I understand, that it was only an example (as e.g. in Poland also no such policy is observed), so authors should specify it, indicating in what other countries such problems associated with lack of fortification policy are being observed.	{"347, 359, ACTION","369, 384, CONTENT","492, 499, MODAL","499, 507, ACTION","152, 164, LOCATION","203, 249, CONTENT","0, 13, LOCATION","282, 288, MODAL","337, 344, MODAL","511, 522, ACTION","288, 306, ACTION","522, 623, CONTENT","507, 509, CONTENT","359, 365, TRIGGER","130, 134, TRIGGER","274, 281, LOCATION","306, 332, CONTENT"}

8298	Conclusions - as authors concluded, that F-FFQ is a valid instrument, they should present it - maybe as an additional table, or present references (where readers could find it) - the conclusion has a low practical impact, as a reader receives an information that questionnaire is valid, but nobody knows the questionnaire tool	{"227, 326, CONTENT","136, 146, CONTENT","125, 127, TRIGGER","179, 193, LOCATION","82, 90, ACTION","75, 82, MODAL","90, 92, CONTENT","95, 100, TRIGGER","41, 68, CONTENT","200, 220, ACTION","0, 11, LOCATION","107, 123, CONTENT"}

8307	In the presented work Karabelas et al. provided a fouling study operating the filtration unit at different fluxes and using foulants with different composition. The presented work is interesting and has some merits but in its current form it lacks of novelty and impact. The quality of manuscript is poor with data duplication. The manuscript should go through a thorough revision before a final decision is made.	{"361, 380, CONTENT","7, 21, LOCATION","215, 219, TRIGGER","350, 360, ACTION","242, 269, ACTION","343, 350, MODAL","297, 304, ACTION","332, 342, LOCATION","161, 179, LOCATION","310, 326, ACTION","286, 296, LOCATION","275, 282, CONTENT"}
8308	1) What was the rationale for using dead-end filtration configuration? In industrial UF plants cross-flow operation is applied. The fouling mechanism in cross-flow and dead-end configuration is inevitably different which questions the impact of the presented study. A statement should be included  within the manuscript why dead-end configuration was chosen, and its implications.	{"320, 323, TRIGGER","309, 319, LOCATION","278, 285, MODAL","288, 298, ACTION","324, 379, CONTENT","8, 69, CONTENT","268, 278, CONTENT","3, 8, TRIGGER"}
8309	2) The results and discussion section included lot of citations for references 29 and 31. The concluding remarks of the study have been already observed in previous investigations (?), which questions the novelty of the proposed study. The authors should emphasise and discuss their own results, which should be clearly distinguished  from the literature.	{"255, 265, ACTION","68, 81, LOCATION","86, 88, LOCATION","94, 112, LOCATION","191, 212, ACTION","248, 255, MODAL","220, 234, LOCATION","335, 354, CONTENT","185, 191, TRIGGER","7, 37, LOCATION","320, 335, ACTION","302, 309, MODAL","277, 294, CONTENT","269, 277, ACTION"}
8310	3) Throughout the manuscript there were no error bars reported within the results. All result should have an error bar to indicate the uncertainty of experiment. Error bars can be obtained  by carrying out the experiment again, or by testing another membrane coupon in parallel, etc. The source of error bar should be also included  within the manuscript.	{"74, 81, LOCATION","18, 29, LOCATION","94, 101, MODAL","101, 119, ACTION","87, 94, CONTENT","122, 160, CONTENT","323, 333, ACTION","40, 62, ACTION","288, 307, CONTENT","344, 354, LOCATION","308, 315, MODAL"}
8311	4) The authors claimed that a systematic fouling study was provided. However, only one type of membrane was investigated within their studies. The authors should explain and clarify in the main text what is meant by systematic.	{"162, 170, ACTION","189, 198, LOCATION","204, 226, CONTENT","199, 203, TRIGGER","134, 141, LOCATION","83, 120, CONTENT","78, 82, ACTION","69, 76, TRIGGER","155, 162, MODAL","174, 182, ACTION"}
8312	5) Figure 1 and Figure 3 provide the same information. The number of figures in this manuscript is excessive. The number of figures should be minimized , and data duplication should be avoided . Therefore, Figure 1 and Figure 3 should be combined  (with two‘x’ axes) or Figure 3 should be moved  to the supplementary information. Similarly, Figure 5 and Figure 6 provide the same data in different representation form. Therefore Figure 5 should be omitted and placed  within the supplementary information.	{"289, 296, ACTION","479, 504, LOCATION","460, 468, ACTION","448, 456, ACTION","438, 445, MODAL","419, 429, TRIGGER","354, 362, LOCATION","341, 349, LOCATION","303, 328, LOCATION","279, 286, MODAL","238, 248, ACTION","228, 235, MODAL","158, 174, CONTENT","185, 193, ACTION","175, 182, MODAL","114, 131, CONTENT","142, 152, ACTION","132, 139, MODAL","96, 108, ACTION","59, 76, CONTENT","16, 24, LOCATION","3, 11, LOCATION","37, 53, CONTENT","85, 95, LOCATION","206, 214, LOCATION","219, 227, LOCATION","270, 278, LOCATION","363, 384, ACTION","429, 437, LOCATION"}
8313	6) The authors collected 100 mL permeate at 60 Lm^-2h^-1. With a membrane area of 12.7 cm^2 the washing and compaction of membrane were performed 1.31 h. Is the time provided sufficient for the membrane compaction? Did the authors investigate the TMP during the compaction process? The authors should ensure steady-state TMP prior to the fouling studies as it could affect the results.	{"360, 366, MODAL","215, 218, TRIGGER","157, 213, CONTENT","154, 156, TRIGGER","308, 324, CONTENT","366, 384, CONTENT","301, 308, ACTION","294, 301, MODAL","354, 356, TRIGGER","334, 353, CONTENT","325, 333, TRIGGER","219, 280, CONTENT"}
8314	7) In Figure 6, the authors only fitted linear trend on 4 out of 6 data points (for datasets 0% SA – 100% BSA). It is incorrect to assume that the exponent of that linear trend is 0.4 and correlates with the exponent reported in the literature, as the trend was not fitted to all the data.	{"248, 257, CONTENT","276, 288, CONTENT","6, 14, LOCATION","118, 137, ACTION","258, 272, ACTION","28, 32, ACTION","33, 110, CONTENT","138, 142, TRIGGER","143, 243, CONTENT","245, 247, TRIGGER"}
8315	8) There are data missing for 25% and 50% SA resistance at 75 L m^-2h^-1 and for 75% resistance at 88 L m^-2h^-1 (Figure 5). Why were the data omitted? The authors should explain why those data were not presented within the manuscript.	{"164, 171, MODAL","171, 179, ACTION","30, 112, CONTENT","125, 129, TRIGGER","224, 234, LOCATION","129, 150, CONTENT","18, 26, ACTION","179, 182, TRIGGER","183, 212, CONTENT","114, 122, LOCATION","13, 18, CONTENT"}
8316	9) Fouling resistance works on UF membranes should be mentioned  in the introduction (J. Membr. Sci., 2017, 541, 300-311; J. Membr. Sci., 2017, 533, 141-159).	{"84, 157, CONTENT","72, 84, LOCATION","54, 65, ACTION","44, 51, MODAL","3, 43, CONTENT"}
8317	10) The authors should provide quantitative statements about the main research results in the conclusion section.	{"16, 23, MODAL","31, 86, CONTENT","23, 31, ACTION","94, 112, LOCATION"}
8318	11) What was the rationale for choosing PAN for the membrane material? The authors should explain within the manuscript.	{"109, 119, LOCATION","9, 69, CONTENT","83, 90, MODAL","4, 9, TRIGGER","90, 98, ACTION"}
8319	12) What was the rationale for choosing the total organic matter concentration 30 mg L^-1 and the concentration of BSA and SA? Are the selected concentration values relevant to the industry? The authors should explain within the manuscript.	{"229, 239, LOCATION","4, 9, TRIGGER","131, 189, CONTENT","9, 89, CONTENT","203, 210, MODAL","94, 125, CONTENT","127, 130, TRIGGER","210, 218, ACTION"}
8320	13) The authors should acknowledge in the introduction the previous report (ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 2017, 9, 11279–11289) detailing the effect of solvent conditioning of membranes. Solvent treatment of membranes can significantly alter the membrane performance and could mitigate the fouling   of membranes.	{"59, 126, CONTENT","137, 184, CONTENT","16, 23, MODAL","23, 35, ACTION","42, 54, LOCATION","127, 137, ACTION"}
8321	14) The authors should include flux recovery studies within the manuscript.	{"23, 31, ACTION","31, 52, CONTENT","64, 74, LOCATION","16, 23, MODAL"}
8322	15) The authors should provide a process scheme for their fouling  studies.	{"16, 23, MODAL","33, 74, CONTENT","23, 31, ACTION"}
8323	16) The authors should avoid bulk referencing  i.e., [24–29].	{"16, 23, MODAL","29, 45, CONTENT","53, 60, LOCATION","23, 29, ACTION"}
8324	17) The authors should provide a comparison table within the manuscript which summarizes and compares the obtained fouling  results (i.e., correlation of specific resistance data or flux recovery) in the presented study with the results obtained in the literature.	{"61, 72, LOCATION","106, 196, CONTENT","23, 31, ACTION","78, 89, ACTION","16, 23, MODAL","33, 49, CONTENT","93, 102, ACTION","204, 219, LOCATION"}
8325	18) The authors should include the length of fouling  experiments within the experimental section.	{"77, 97, LOCATION","16, 23, MODAL","35, 65, CONTENT","23, 31, ACTION"}
8326	19) The space occupied by figures should be kept at minimum. I.e., Instead of placing the figure panels below each other (Figure 4) occupying one and a half pages, the panels can be placed  next to each other, occupying only half a page. Similarly, the space occupied by Figure 9 and Figure 10 can be minimized .	{"190, 236, CONTENT","284, 293, LOCATION","67, 77, TRIGGER","78, 120, CONTENT","294, 298, MODAL","168, 174, LOCATION","238, 247, TRIGGER","26, 33, LOCATION","8, 13, CONTENT","34, 41, MODAL","122, 130, LOCATION","301, 311, ACTION","175, 179, MODAL","44, 59, ACTION","182, 190, ACTION","271, 279, LOCATION","253, 267, CONTENT"}
8327	20) All panels within a figure should be labelled  (A, B, C, D). All panels should be described  within the figure caption.	{"108, 122, LOCATION","4, 14, CONTENT","24, 30, LOCATION","41, 51, ACTION","31, 38, MODAL","76, 83, MODAL","69, 75, CONTENT","86, 97, ACTION"}
8328	21) The quality of Figure 10 and Figure 12 is low. The authors should improve the figure quality.	{"63, 70, MODAL","70, 78, ACTION","19, 28, LOCATION","33, 42, LOCATION","8, 15, CONTENT","43, 49, ACTION","82, 96, CONTENT"}
8329	22) The title of axes on Figure 11 is not legible. All axes titles, units and information on figures should be legible.	{"93, 100, LOCATION","8, 21, CONTENT","35, 49, ACTION","25, 34, LOCATION","101, 108, MODAL","111, 118, ACTION","51, 89, CONTENT"}
8330	23) The authors should be consistent throughout the manuscript. I.e., ? is usually used for resistance on the y axis title, however, in Figure 5“initial specific resistance” was used as the axis title. Another example is the different font size or font style used for the panel labels.	{"16, 23, MODAL","23, 36, ACTION","52, 62, LOCATION","136, 144, LOCATION","144, 173, LOCATION","124, 131, TRIGGER","92, 122, CONTENT"}

8332	The manuscript by Martikainen and co-workers describes wastewater treatment with sand filters in Finland. The work is novel, a reasonable amount of data is presented. In general the topic is of interests to the readers of water. However, there are some issues that must be addressed  prior to publication.	{"229, 236, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","265, 270, MODAL","110, 114, LOCATION","248, 259, CONTENT","273, 284, ACTION"}
8333	1. The sample preparation and any possible treatment should be described  under section 2.	{"7, 52, CONTENT","63, 74, ACTION","53, 60, MODAL","80, 89, LOCATION"}
8334	2. The experiments carried out in duplicates meaning that independently applied sand filters were used, or the same filters were sued and two samples were taken, or one sample was taken and analysed twice?

8335	3. The introduction should mention sustainable efforts for wastewater treatment. Sand filters are one of the simplest, and possibly greenest, solutions. However, several processes and materials have been developed for sustainable wastewater treatment that should be summarised  in the introduction: Journal of Cleaner Production, 2016, 130, 103-115; Green Chem., 2015, 17, 5196-5205; Energy Environ.

8338	6. The results and the discussion were split into two sections. These section should be better connected . The discussion section (4) should be linked  to the results section (3) via referring to the figures and panel in section 3.

8348	8. The conclusions section should summarize the main research findings, and preferably it should include some quantitative statements. The drawbacks and limitations of the methods should also be mentioned to add a critical edge. On the contrary, the abstract section should contain less quantitative information and should read more general.	{"195, 205, ACTION","90, 97, MODAL","97, 105, ACTION","110, 133, CONTENT","328, 340, CONTENT","180, 187, MODAL","48, 70, CONTENT","34, 44, ACTION","27, 34, MODAL","7, 26, LOCATION","139, 179, CONTENT","250, 266, LOCATION","267, 274, MODAL","274, 282, ACTION","282, 311, CONTENT","323, 328, ACTION","316, 323, MODAL"}
8349	The manuscript entitled „Association between vitamin D intake and bone mineral density in Koreans aged ?50 years: Analysis of the 2009 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey using a newly established vitamin D database” presents an interesting issue, but it requires some important revisions.	{"288, 307, CONTENT","4, 14, LOCATION","24, 235, LOCATION","274, 283, ACTION","267, 271, TRIGGER"}
8350	Most important is the fact, that the information about vitamin D intake are not accurate. One problem is associated with the fact, that assessment of the vitamin D intake on the basis of the 24-h recall is flawed (especially in the case of such nutrient as vitamin D that is obtained from the specific food products that are not consumed each day). Moreover, Authors present no information about the way in which 24-h recall was conducted, so reader receives almost no information about obtaining the most important data (vitamin D intake), that for the journal analyzing the intake of nutrients is crucial.	{"349, 357, TRIGGER","191, 202, CONTENT","596, 606, ACTION","275, 315, CONTENT","522, 538, CONTENT","413, 438, CONTENT","37, 71, CONTENT","72, 88, ACTION","203, 212, ACTION","554, 595, CONTENT","136, 170, CONTENT","367, 389, ACTION"}

They should remove some information about osteoporosis that for the aim of the study are irrelevant. At the same time, they should indicate necessary data about fish products and dairy products intake in the Korean population.

8368	Authors should deeply reformulate their discussion, as the discussion should be closely associated  with the aim of the study. Authors should not discuss the other issues, that are not related to the aim of the study, e.g. aging associated with the reduction of BMD, glucose and insulin level in osteoporosis individuals, etc. Instead, they should discuss the aimed association and the role of specific food products. As the aim of their study they indicated associations between vitamin D intake and BMD, so the intake should be treated  as the major result, while currently it is treated as just a minor factor.	{"88, 98, ACTION","135, 141, MODAL","8, 14, MODAL","142, 153, ACTION","347, 355, ACTION","327, 334, TRIGGER","356, 416, CONTENT","520, 526, MODAL","530, 537, ACTION","22, 34, ACTION","459, 504, CONTENT","509, 519, CONTENT","539, 558, CONTENT","40, 50, LOCATION","566, 612, CONTENT","560, 565, TRIGGER","341, 347, MODAL","154, 325, CONTENT","70, 76, MODAL","59, 69, CONTENT","100, 125, CONTENT"}

They did not specify the association between vitamin D intake and BMD neither at the end of the Discussion Section, nor in the Abstract “Vitamin D intake did not differ by BMD status; however, the lower the BMD, the lower was the vitamin D intake.” – it may seem to be contradictory after reading  only Abstract).

8423	6. It is not clear what the matrix for the rutin analysis is. It seems that the authors used a single solute solution of rutin for their work, and then in section 3.6 applied the electrode using real samples. How does the real matrix affect the detection performance of the electrode developed? The reported linearity range and LOD are determined using a single solute solution or real samples? This should be mentioned  in the abstract and the conclusions as well.	{"381, 393, CONTENT","457, 464, TRIGGER","400, 406, MODAL","295, 377, CONTENT","213, 293, CONTENT","155, 166, LOCATION","441, 456, LOCATION","421, 436, LOCATION","410, 421, ACTION","378, 380, TRIGGER","209, 212, TRIGGER","19, 60, CONTENT","9, 18, ACTION"}

8426	9. The detection method was optimised by changing one factor at a time, the pH was optimised, then the accumulation time etc. However, it should be mentioned  that the Design of Experiments approach could further enhance the optimisation process because the various factors can be studied  simultaneously revealing their interactions (J.

8429	The manuscript entitled “Monitoring excreted gluten immunogenic peptides as a new tool to study protein metabolism and for the management of gluten intolerances” presents the interesting issue, but it requires some major corrections, including those associated with ethical issues.	{"210, 280, CONTENT","24, 161, LOCATION","194, 197, TRIGGER","201, 210, ACTION","0, 14, LOCATION"}
8430	The serious flaw of the presented manuscript is associated with the fact, that it presents a highly subjective review, not a systematic review. While the systematic review has a key role in the evidence-based medicine, the other reviews don’t have such role. Taking into account, that the Materials and methods section is not presented, without any specific information, it is hard to understand which studies were included into review and why. In spite of the fact that Authors presented some key words (lines 90-93: “protein metabolism urine”, “protein detection urine”, “protein detection feces”, “gluten detection urine”, “gluten detection feces”, “follow-up celiac disease”, “gluten-free diet monitoring”, “gluten-free diet adherence”, “gluten-free diet children”, “gluten-free diet adolescent”, “refractory celiac disease”, “non-responsive celiac disease”), they did not indicate how was the search conducted (all key words combined? In pairs? Or any other option…). Moreover, they also indicated additional key words (lines 93-95: “gluten immunogenic peptides”, “celiac disease”; “gluten metabolism”; “gluten excretion”, “gluten peptides fate”), so reader has no idea how in fact was the search conducted.	{"600, 624, LOCATION","573, 598, LOCATION","869, 885, ACTION","322, 335, ACTION","1069, 1085, LOCATION","886, 971, CONTENT","1108, 1126, LOCATION","1087, 1106, LOCATION","1128, 1150, LOCATION","1156, 1174, ACTION","289, 319, LOCATION","711, 739, LOCATION","34, 44, LOCATION","830, 861, LOCATION","4, 16, ACTION","801, 828, LOCATION","770, 799, LOCATION","652, 678, LOCATION","680, 709, LOCATION","741, 768, LOCATION","505, 516, LOCATION","518, 544, LOCATION","546, 571, LOCATION","626, 650, LOCATION","1025, 1036, LOCATION","93, 117, CONTENT","377, 395, ACTION","1187, 1211, CONTENT","1175, 1178, TRIGGER","973, 981, TRIGGER","396, 443, CONTENT","1038, 1067, LOCATION","119, 142, ACTION"}
8431	Moreover, Authors did not present any inclusion and exclusion criteria of references, number of chosen references, as well as information if some of them were excluded from the review and on the basis of which criteria. Flow chart is highly recommended to be presented.	{"259, 268, ACTION","220, 230, CONTENT","38, 218, CONTENT","18, 33, ACTION"}
8432	The abovementioned problem of the lack of specified inclusion/ exclusion criteria of the references to the review (resulting in the risk of dishonest choice of references) is becoming even more serious, as all the Authors have a important conflict of interest, as they all are employees of Biomedal SL, which offers the products which are described by Authors in their review. Authors applied very controversial procedure of presenting the detailed analysis that were conducted while using the products of their company (lines 296-301, 305-308, 319-321, Table 3). It may be perceived  as a serious ethical issue, as the constant emphasizing the role of their company and its products may be indicating as just advertising . Especially if Authors did not prepare research article, but a review, constant indicating minor methodological aspects, only to mention the company name does not present any information essential for the study. Authors applied not recommended procedure of referring not only published data, but also: Their manuscripts being in preparation (e.g. lines 108, 211, 322, 323) Unpublished data of their company (e.g. lines 308, 310-313)	{"554, 561, LOCATION","574, 611, CONTENT","567, 570, MODAL","877, 893, ACTION","951, 976, CONTENT","1070, 1079, LOCATION","1025, 1063, CONTENT","1015, 1023, TRIGGER","999, 1013, CONTENT","990, 998, TRIGGER","1081, 1084, LOCATION","1086, 1089, LOCATION","1091, 1094, LOCATION","684, 687, MODAL","89, 99, LOCATION","398, 421, ACTION","521, 534, LOCATION","536, 543, LOCATION","545, 552, LOCATION","1136, 1145, LOCATION","1147, 1154, LOCATION","1096, 1129, CONTENT","894, 933, CONTENT"}
8433	Authors must be aware, that for the review article, the most important issue is the reliability of applied references, so they cannot base their manuscript on the data that are not available for other researchers/ readers of their manuscript, as is causes that their thesis are of a low credibility.	{"80, 95, CONTENT","71, 79, ACTION","107, 117, LOCATION","127, 138, ACTION","145, 155, LOCATION","163, 221, CONTENT","283, 298, ACTION","231, 241, LOCATION"}

8507	The novel work by Shao et al. is of interest to a broader engineering community but the manuscript need to be improved prior to publication. The work is detailed enough to ensure understanding, the majority of the manuscript reads well and built in a logical manner. The introduction is too narrow and needs to discuss broader context for which recommendations have been given. Some calculations and presentation of the data need to be improved.	{"319, 376, CONTENT","378, 424, CONTENT","99, 104, MODAL","110, 119, ACTION","302, 308, MODAL","311, 319, ACTION","425, 430, MODAL","436, 444, ACTION","271, 283, LOCATION","214, 224, LOCATION","80, 84, TRIGGER","84, 98, LOCATION"}

8509	2) A general introduction and recent examples to sustainable wastewater treatment should be provided  in the introduction in order to introduce the topic in its broad context. The trend is to develop materials and processes which are sustainable. Such trend and recent examples which aim to address the problems listed in lines 47-49 should be provided : hydrodynamic cavitational technique (Ultrason. Sonochem. 2002, 9(3), 123-131), molecular imprinting (Green Chem., 2015, 17, 5196-5205), and microbial fuel cells (Energy Environ.

8512	5) Statements such as“CWSBR was the most sustainable wastewater treatment process, followed by BAF, A2O and CAST.” should be rephrased  to provide quantitative comparison if possible. If quantitative comparison is not possible then the basis of the comparison should be explicitly mentioned .	{"187, 226, CONTENT","281, 291, ACTION","125, 136, ACTION","232, 259, CONTENT","260, 267, MODAL","21, 114, LOCATION","227, 232, TRIGGER","115, 122, MODAL","184, 187, TRIGGER"}
8513	6) The fundamental works on emergy analysis such as Ecological Engineering 9 (1997) 51–69 should be mentioned  in the article. In line 78 it is specifically mentioned that emergy analysis has traditionally been focusing on a single process and not process comparison.

8515	8) Some abbreviations are introduced in the main text such as EYR but others (e.g. ELR) are only introduced in tables. For consistency, all abbreviations should be spelled  out in either both tables and text or only where they first appear. Consistency is needed for the currency as well as in certain cases yuan is spelled out in other cases its symbol is used.	{"241, 253, ACTION","136, 153, CONTENT","164, 176, ACTION","211, 239, CONTENT","208, 211, TRIGGER","256, 263, MODAL","180, 187, TRIGGER","187, 207, CONTENT","263, 279, CONTENT","154, 161, MODAL"}

8523	The manuscript by Li and co-workers gives insights into the preparation and characterization of copolymers. The work is interesting and the findings are of interest to a broad scientific community including polymer chemists, analytical chemists, and materials scientists.

8649	1.      The main problem is associated with the applied classification of sleepers – short, reference and long sleepers. In the presented manuscript the sleep duration in a category of“short sleepers” is quite long, as they slept less than 7 hours a day. In the Materials and Methods section, Authors indicated 3 references for their classification, but in 2 of them, short sleepers are those who sleep less than 6 hours, that is in general more reasonable. The following categories are in referred studies: <6, 6-8, >8 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22951155), 5-6, 7-8 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25137304). Taking it into account, the referred studies do not justify the categories in the presented study. Moreover, the referred studies indicate the main weakness of the study – the fact, that in the“short sleepers” there were not only“real” short sleepers, but also typical sleepers. In my opinion, the results should be recalculated  to present the association for more reasonable categories, or at least the additional analysis should be conducted  for“real” short sleepers sub-category.	{"153, 200, CONTENT","919, 930, CONTENT","931, 937, MODAL","958, 965, ACTION","262, 291, LOCATION","970, 1012, CONTENT","1030, 1049, CONTENT","1050, 1056, MODAL","1060, 1069, ACTION","941, 953, ACTION","1071, 1108, CONTENT","673, 684, ACTION","1014, 1016, TRIGGER","724, 732, TRIGGER","128, 148, LOCATION","689, 723, CONTENT","653, 669, CONTENT","201, 214, ACTION"}
8650	2.      The second very important problem is associated with the fact, that Authors indicated the need for“more studies to assess the relationship between sleep measures and FV intakes using validated detailed dietary assessment”, but the tools that they used were not validated (or they were validated, but the validation is not indicated). Due to a number of problems with the conducted analysis of intake (problems associated for materials and Methods section: the analysis not conducted during typical days, the day not representative for a week), it should be indicated , that the presented study does not solve the problem that was specified in the Introduction section, as it was not based on“validated detailed dietary assessment”. As there is no possibility to correct it now, in my opinion, it needs the extensive explanation and indicating it as a serious limitation of the study.	{"677, 679, TRIGGER","231, 235, TRIGGER","260, 278, ACTION","280, 282, TRIGGER","303, 307, TRIGGER","288, 302, ACTION","607, 616, ACTION","617, 647, CONTENT","804, 809, ACTION","810, 835, CONTENT","239, 244, CONTENT","312, 322, CONTENT","326, 339, ACTION","433, 462, LOCATION","555, 561, MODAL","565, 574, ACTION","655, 675, LOCATION","687, 696, ACTION","586, 601, LOCATION","699, 738, CONTENT","740, 742, TRIGGER","839, 850, ACTION","859, 890, CONTENT"}

8680	9, The figure captions are very short, in some cases only two words. More informative 1-2 lines of captions would help the readers to better understand the figures and follow the manuscript.	{"69, 107, CONTENT","23, 37, ACTION","7, 22, LOCATION","108, 113, MODAL","114, 118, ACTION"}

8684	The manuscript details the fabrication and characterization of a novel coagulant (PATC) for the treatment of low turbidity water. This comprehensive study includes optimization of reaction conditions such as temperature, pH, elemental ratios, PATC initial dosage and settling time effects on removal of turbidity and morphology of flocculation. The experimental data is reinforced by an orthogonal simulation study with various combinations of reaction conditions. This study presents complementary experimental and theoretical findings encompassing the fields of engineering and purification, whilst tackling complex chemical processes; this manuscript is therefore well-suited to the scope of the journal Processes. Hence, the manuscript should be further considered to be published  after carefully addressing the comments below:	{"718, 723, TRIGGER","725, 739, LOCATION","149, 154, LOCATION","740, 746, MODAL","4, 14, LOCATION","470, 475, LOCATION","750, 768, ACTION","643, 653, LOCATION","345, 366, LOCATION"}
8685	1.       The quality and presentation of the figures throughout the manuscript need to be improved before publication.	{"90, 98, ACTION","13, 52, CONTENT","53, 78, LOCATION"}
8686	·        The morphology of Al figures (Figures 3, 5, 7, 9) are slightly hard to read, with three different percentage scales on the same figure. These could be altered  to using only one y-axis or having the axes clearly labelled with percentages. This would make it easier for the reader to decipher the morphology distribution for different reaction conditions.	{"207, 246, CONTENT","253, 258, MODAL","259, 273, ACTION","39, 57, LOCATION","91, 143, CONTENT","160, 167, ACTION","27, 37, LOCATION","151, 156, MODAL","168, 193, CONTENT","194, 196, TRIGGER","197, 203, ACTION","274, 362, CONTENT"}
8687	·        The FTIR spectra (Figure 10) is very grainy with small features, this makes it hard to read axis and wavenumber annotations. This image should be improved  in quality and, if possible, assign wavenumbers to important specific bond stretching vibrations on the figure e.g Al-O-Al, Si-O-Si, O-H.	{"155, 163, ACTION","134, 144, LOCATION","145, 151, MODAL","194, 200, ACTION","201, 302, CONTENT","13, 26, LOCATION","168, 175, CONTENT","27, 36, LOCATION"}
8688	·        The XRD patterns (Figure 11, 12) are also grainy with numbers and text extremely difficult to determine. These features should be increased  in size to improve the figure before publication.	{"129, 136, MODAL","153, 157, CONTENT","173, 179, CONTENT","139, 148, ACTION","13, 26, LOCATION","161, 168, ACTION","27, 40, LOCATION","114, 128, CONTENT"}
8689	·        The SEM images (Figure 13) are also poorly presented. The letter assignment of the image (a), (b) sometimes overlaps with the image itself and as with previous images, the text and numbers in (b) and (d) are hard to read. The presentation of important images such as these needs to be re-structured before publication.	{"235, 267, CONTENT","45, 61, ACTION","294, 307, ACTION","25, 34, LOCATION","67, 106, CONTENT","107, 116, TRIGGER","13, 23, LOCATION","117, 147, CONTENT","152, 154, TRIGGER","160, 229, CONTENT"}
8690	·        For Figure 16, the axis and caption label of zata potential should be amended  to zeta potential.	{"28, 68, LOCATION","91, 105, CONTENT","69, 75, MODAL","13, 22, LOCATION","79, 86, ACTION"}
8691	2.       The presenting of data in table form could also be improved throughout the manuscript; tables should be well-structured, concise and easy for the reader to follow.	{"80, 94, LOCATION","9, 45, CONTENT","103, 109, MODAL","96, 102, LOCATION","60, 68, ACTION","46, 51, MODAL","113, 128, ACTION","130, 137, ACTION"}
8692	·        Table 3, which documents the orthogonal test results, presents lots of information, some of which is hard to follow. There consist 25 separate entries in the table, of which it is hard for the reader to establish a trend. To make the table more information rich, it should perhaps only include selected entries with a high removal rate of turbidity. The rest of the test results could be moved  to a Supporting information section. This would make it easier for the reader to view which parameters resulted in the best removal of turbidity.	{"163, 172, LOCATION","359, 387, CONTENT","303, 357, CONTENT","295, 302, ACTION","275, 281, MODAL","9, 16, LOCATION","409, 439, LOCATION","388, 393, MODAL","397, 402, ACTION"}
8693	·        The representation of table entries e.g A2B5D2E5 should also be specified. It is likely that these correspond to the initial letter and number assignments given in Table 1, however if this is the case it should be specified before or mentioned  in reference to Table 3. This would allow for the reader to refer back to Table 1 as a point of reference for the experiment parameters.	{"9, 44, CONTENT","253, 266, CONTENT","240, 242, TRIGGER","328, 335, LOCATION","270, 277, LOCATION","173, 180, LOCATION","213, 219, MODAL","182, 189, TRIGGER","223, 232, ACTION","243, 252, ACTION","73, 82, ACTION","58, 64, MODAL","49, 57, CONTENT"}
8694	3.       At the end of the Introduction section, the author should emphasise the novelty of the study. For example, this study presents for the first time the preparation process of polyaluminum titanium silicate chloride and its flocculation performance. This allows the reader to distinguish this work from other similar studies i.e polyaluminum titanium silicate sulfate coagulant as prepared by Chang et al.	{"12, 47, LOCATION","116, 255, CONTENT","81, 101, CONTENT","67, 76, ACTION","60, 66, MODAL"}
8695	4.       In the results or conclusion section, the author(s) could include a small table or paragraph comparing  the turbidity removal of PATC to similar coagulants (e.g. by Chang et al.) and some commercially available aluminium coagulants e.g The minimum turbidity of 0.44 NTU for PATC is comparable to that of the coagulant prepared by Chang et al. (0.36 NTU). This will highlight the potential impact of the application proposed in the manuscript.	{"16, 45, LOCATION","436, 450, LOCATION","66, 74, ACTION","61, 66, MODAL","245, 362, CONTENT","77, 240, CONTENT"}
8696	5.       The trend toward sustainable water treatment processes should be briefly mentioned in the introduction and backed  up with some recent process examples: Green Chem. 2015, 17, 5196-5205 and J. Cleaner Prod. 2017, 162, 484-490.	{"64, 70, MODAL","99, 111, LOCATION","116, 126, ACTION","127, 234, CONTENT","82, 91, ACTION","9, 63, CONTENT"}
8697	6.       The author(s) could suggest a possible reaction scheme or mechanism for the formation of PATC from its reagents (Sodium Silicate, AlCl3, TiCl4, NaOH).	{"23, 28, MODAL","29, 36, ACTION","67, 159, CONTENT","64, 66, TRIGGER","39, 63, CONTENT"}
8698	7.       Page 2, Line 65 should be amended  to: In the present study, we present the preparation process of polyaluminum titanium silicate chloride (PATC).	{"9, 15, LOCATION","48, 155, CONTENT","17, 24, LOCATION","25, 31, MODAL","35, 42, ACTION"}
8699	8.       Page 4, Line 155 A reference should be provided  for the statement: Temperature can affect the hydrolysis of metal salts, and extremely high or excessively low temperatures are not conducive to the preparation of efficient coagulants.	{"9, 15, LOCATION","77, 243, CONTENT","28, 37, CONTENT","48, 57, ACTION","38, 44, MODAL","17, 25, LOCATION"}
8700	9.       Page 6, Line 202. The sentence‘This phenomenon can be explained  as n(Ti)/n(Al) ratio increasing; that is, the content of Ti (IV) in the coagulant increased relatively, the content of Al (III) decreased naturally, and a competitive relationship formed between the hydrolysis of Ti (IV) and Al(III)’ should be re-structured before publication.	{"17, 25, LOCATION","40, 306, CONTENT","318, 331, ACTION","308, 314, MODAL","9, 15, LOCATION"}
8701	10.   Page 9, Line 292. Grammatical error, the sentence should be corrected  to: different chemical environment. In addition, the comparison between the two spectra showed that	{"24, 41, CONTENT","56, 62, MODAL","14, 22, LOCATION","66, 75, ACTION","81, 111, CONTENT","6, 12, LOCATION"}
8702	11.   Page 12, Line 376. The author(s) should define what is meant by the term‘P factor’ with regards to the orthogonal test and how this can measure the effect on coagulation. The P = 0.000 of factor B in Table 4 shows that the amount of coagulant dosage had a significant effect on coagulation.	{"46, 52, ACTION","53, 57, TRIGGER","181, 202, LOCATION","39, 45, MODAL","58, 175, CONTENT","15, 23, LOCATION","6, 13, LOCATION","206, 213, LOCATION"}
8703	12.   Page 13, Line 420. The PATC treatment effect on low-turbidity water was superior. The author(s) should specify TO what PATC is superior and provide a statement justifying  this e.g. reference a comparable result (PAC).	{"109, 116, ACTION","156, 223, CONTENT","117, 141, CONTENT","102, 108, MODAL","6, 13, LOCATION","15, 23, LOCATION","146, 153, ACTION"}
8704	The manuscript by Elrasheedy and co-workers reviews the field of MOF-based MMMs for water treatment. The literature is worthwhile to be summarized in this context. The content of the manuscript fits well in the scope of the journal. However, there are several issues that must be addressed  before publishing the work. The main criticism is the fact that the review needs to be more than a simple compilation of literature. The detailed comments to improve the manuscript are given below.	{"272, 276, MODAL","164, 193, LOCATION","233, 240, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","252, 266, CONTENT","280, 289, ACTION","323, 422, CONTENT"}
8705	1. The authors should provide some future perspective on the field of MOF-MMM. What’s next? What are the current challenges of the field that needs to be addressed? What are the potential solutions to explore?	{"101, 163, CONTENT","79, 84, TRIGGER","15, 21, MODAL","165, 169, TRIGGER","35, 77, CONTENT","22, 29, ACTION","92, 96, TRIGGER","174, 208, CONTENT"}
