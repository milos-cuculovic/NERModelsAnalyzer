§  O
I O
have O
serious O
concerns O
regarding O
the O
way O
how B-TRIGGER
the O
authors O
of O
the O
manuscript O
under O
review O
have O
performed O
the O
literature O
review O
. O
  O
In O
a O
scientific O
article O
, O
an O
important O
role O
of O
the“Introduction” O
section B-LOCATION
is O
to O
offer O
authors O
the O
opportunity O
to O
analyze O
in O

the O
current O

related O

the O

topic O
, O
namely O
the O
most O
relevant O
scientific O
works O
in O
the O
field O
in O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
contextualize O
their O
study O
and O
familiarize O
the O
readers O
with O
what B-TRIGGER
has O
been O
done O
in O
the O

what B-TRIGGER
advancement O
their O
study O
aims O
to O
bring O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
existing O
body O
of O
knowledge O
. O
I O
consider O
that B-TRIGGER
it O
is B-ACTION
not I-ACTION
appropriate I-ACTION
for O
the O
manuscript O
to O
cover O
eight O
( O
like B-TRIGGER

) O
or B-TRIGGER
even O
more O

§  O
I O
consider O
that B-TRIGGER
the O
authors O
should B-MODAL
perform B-ACTION
the O
literature O
review O
in O
a O
manner O
that B-TRIGGER
emphasizes O
for O
each O
scientific O
work O
that B-TRIGGER
was O
cited O
in O
the O
text O
of O
the O
manuscript O
the O
contribution O
that B-TRIGGER
was O
made O
to O
the O
existing O

art O
, O
the O
approach O
that B-TRIGGER
was O
employed O
along O
with O
a O
short O
description O
of O
the O
most O
important O
results O
that B-TRIGGER
have O
been O
obtained O
along O
with O
the O
existing O
unsolved O
issues O
of O
the O
referenced O
studies O
. O
By O
doing O
so O
, O
the O
authors O
will B-MODAL
be B-ACTION
able I-ACTION
to I-ACTION
better I-ACTION
place I-ACTION
their O
study O
in O
a O
broad O
body O
of O

and O
highlight B-ACTION
unsolved O
problems O
that B-TRIGGER
still O
exist O
regarding O
the O
subject O
that B-TRIGGER
their O
manuscript O
addresses O
. O

§  O
After O
having O
extended B-ACTION
and O
performed B-ACTION
the O
literature O
survey O
in O
an O

manner O
, O
the O
authors O
will B-MODAL

that B-TRIGGER

in O

that B-TRIGGER

In O
the O
current O
form O
of O
the O
manuscript B-LOCATION
the O
authors O
have O
identified O
a O
deficiency O
, O
but B-TRIGGER
I O
consider O
that B-TRIGGER
this O
deficiency O
is B-ACTION
not I-ACTION
substantiated I-ACTION
enough O
due O
to O
an O
improper O
survey O
of O
the O
literature O
review O
that B-TRIGGER
must B-MODAL
be O
addressed B-ACTION
appropriately O
. O
This O
aspect O
will B-MODAL
improve B-ACTION

on O
multiple O

, O
as O
the O
identified O
