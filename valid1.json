{"text": "Remarks regarding the 'Introduction' section, lines 99-105. 'Lim and Kim [22] used the fuzzy logic technique to estimate the reservoir porosity and permeability from well logs. Additional AI tools were used to predict the rock petrophysical properties [23-25]. Elkatatny et al, [26] studied the sonic travel time prediction from the well log data. In drilling engineering, many studies were performed to apply AI science to predict the rate of penetration based on the parameters that affect the drilling performance [27-29]. The prediction of the rock geomechanical properties was studied to predict the rock geomechanics from the well log and 104 drilling data [30-37].'

{"text": "Lines 29-73, the 'Introduction' section. In its current form, the 'Introduction' section contains a series of cited papers. I do not contradict the value of these papers, or their relevance in this context, but I consider that the article under review will benefit if the authors extend this section by analyzing appropriately the cited papers and by analyzing  more other papers in order to contextualize their study. The literature review of the cited papers has been performed in the following manner: 'The induction motors (IMs) account for 80% of industrial motors because of its simple structure and low manufacture cost [7-9]. However, IMs have the secondary copper loss which is typically 25% of the total loss [10]. This secondary copper loss limits the efficiency improvement of IMs. Therefore, in order to replace IMs, new types of motor are being studied to improve the efficiency [11-14]. Synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) receive the attention as the alternative to IMs because SynRM don\u2019t have the secondary copper loss [11, 15]. Moreover, because of a greater saliency ratio, SynRM can produce a large reluctance torque when using  a variable speed drive or electronic controller [10, 16-18]. [\u2026] For this reason, line start synchronous reluctance motor (LS-SynRM) has received attention that it can operate at synchronous speed without the inverter [19-21].' (Lines 42-53). I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 15 (like the authors have did) or even more scientific works in a few lines just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section. In the 'Introduction' section, the authors must introduce a presentation of\u00a0the current state of the research field by reviewing it carefully and by citing other key publications.
