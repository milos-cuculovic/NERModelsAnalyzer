The resolution is too low to be able to see what length the scale bar actually represents.4. Reproducibility should be discussed . Were the catalysts prepared and tested several times? Standard deviations for the obtained data should be presented where possible, in particular Figures 9-10 where the CO conversion is presented.5. Closely related work on CO oxidation should be mentioned  in the introduction such as 10.3390/catal9030256; 10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.10.015; 10.1021/jacs.7b13624 (DOI).6. CO oxidation (in particular at low temperature) is pivotal to the abatement of exhaust gases and therefore ties in well with the increasingly important sustainability efforts in catalysis. A general paragraph on sustainability should be added  to the introduction. Briefly mention the different fields of sustainable solutions via catalysis such as biorefinery (10.1039/C8GC04017F), organocatalysis (10.1021/acscatal.8b01706), waste valorization (10.1039/C9GC00902G), hydrogen evolution (10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b05302), natural laterite (10.1021/acsanm.8b01117).7. The catalysts were washed with isopropanol. The amount expressed as \u201cL solvent per kg catalyst\u201d should be explicitly given under the experimental section. The scale of catalyst fabrication should also be revealed as currently the exact amounts are not disclosed under section 4.1.8. The recovery and reusability of the catalysts should be discussed  in the text. Have the authors performed any repeated experiments on used catalysts? Have they observed any performance decline? What are the criteria for reusing the catalysts? What is the expected lifetime of the catalysts?9. In order to minimize waste and address the sustainability requirements, the authors should mention that the isopropanol could be recycled  using sustainable membrane technologies (solvent recycling) and mention 10.1016/j.jcat.2019.01.041 example.10.

'Over the years, a class of hybrid EAs, called memetic algorithms (MAs), have been widely applied for many complex optimization problems, such as scheduling problems [1\u20133], combinatorial optimization problems [4\u20136], multi-objective optimization problems [7,8] and multimodal optimization problems [9,10]. Population based evolutionary approaches, such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs) or Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), are able to detect in a fast way the main regions of attraction while their local search abilities represent a major drawback [11] from the point of view of the solution accuracy and of the convergence behaviour, specially when applied to multimodal problems. Memetic Algorithms (MAs) [12] have recently received a great attention as effective meta-heuristics to improve generic Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) schemes by combining these latter with local search procedures [11,13].'

' Despite the UCE pilot\u2019s success in terms of emissions reductions and participation, analysis of participants\u2019 demographic data indicates that participants in the UCE pilot were not representative of the ethnic and income demographics of the target ZIP Codes. Several factors may have contributed to this result, including: the distance of UCE pilot event locations from public transit, the lack of culturally relevant messaging, the lack of Spanish-speaking staff at events, and the lack of trusted messengers participating in events. To address the lack of demographic representation among participants, subsequent expansion efforts should include more direct engagement with trusted members of the targeted communities and stronger attempts to engage participants in energy efficiency education.'.

Additional AI tools were used to predict the rock petrophysical properties [23-25]. Elkatatny et al, [26] studied the sonic travel time prediction from the well log data. In drilling engineering, many studies were performed to apply AI science to predict the rate of penetration based on the parameters that affect the drilling performance [27-29]. The prediction of the rock geomechanical properties was studied to predict the rock geomechanics from the well log and 104 drilling data [30-37].'
