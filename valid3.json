Authors answered this issue but they did not specify it in their manuscript. Such choice is a very important bias, as the choice is neither random nor based on any criteria. Is should be extensively described  and in my previous review, I have indicated what should be specified  in Materials and Methods section: how were the diets described to participants, was there any special presentation of diets before a choice, which features were presented, who did present diets, was there any possibility to change ones mind, etc. If Authors state that participants choose diet on their own, that must present the detailed procedure influencing  the choice.Abstract:Authors should justify their study \u2013 indicate why did they plan to conduct the study exactly in athletes on ketogenic diet (what was the need).Authors should precisely describe the obtained data with the specific results.Materials and Methods:The characteristics of diets should be presented  \u2013 the nutritional value and content of products from a specific groups \u2013 not for a specific days (as in the previously published studies) but the mean values as they are crucial to interpret the presented data. \u2013 Authors stated that it is presented in lines 86-93 but it is not. As I stated previously, Authors should present (1) nutritional value (not only macronutrients), (2) content of products from a specific groupsResults:The characteristics of the studied group should be presented  \u2013 especially ethnicity, but also other factors, e.g. gender, BMI, age, previous diet, etc. \u2013 it should be presented  as mean (BMI) or share of a group (ethnicity), not as a detailed characteristics of each participant separately and it should be transferred  from supplementary material to the main body of the study.Discussion:Authors should extensively discuss the possible reasons of their observations, while they should relate the discussion to very specific results that were observed and the fact that it was assessed exactly in athletes.Authors should extensively discuss the limitations of the study associated with the conducted study (e.g. method of diet assessment, etc.) and with the concluding (e.g. possibility to conclude on the basis of conducted research, the choice of diet by participants).Authors should formulate the conclusions from their study \u2013 real are needed \u2013 currently the only conclusion is\u201cto further investigate\u201d.
