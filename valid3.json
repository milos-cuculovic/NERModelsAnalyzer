This flowchart will facilitate the understanding of the proposed approach and in the same time will make the article more interesting  to the readers if used as a graphical abstract. In addition to flowchart, in order to bring a benefit to the manuscript, the authors should state and justify very clear in the 'Materials and Methods' section the choices they have made when developing the final form of their proposed approach.

Several linear or ARIMA-like models and nonlinear models were studied for forecasting electricity consumption in Taiwan [10]. Although ARIMA modeling is widely used for forecasting electricity demand or sales, the linear form of ARIMA models may have difficulty capturing  the nonlinear pattern of electricity sales data [11-13]. ' or \u00a0'Determining Turkey\u2019s electricity consumption using ANN training algorithms has been proposed [19]. A methodology based on ANN was studied to forecast day-ahead electricity spikes and prices in Ontario, Canada [20]. Three techniques for forecasting electricity consumption (regression analysis, decision trees, and ANN) were investigated [21]. Least squares support vector machines were used to forecast electricity consumption in Turkey [22].'.

{"text": "Lines 29-73, the 'Introduction' section. In its current form, the 'Introduction' section contains a series of cited papers. I do not contradict the value of these papers, or their relevance in this context, but I consider that the article under review will benefit if the authors extend this section by analyzing appropriately the cited papers and by analyzing  more other papers in order to contextualize their study. The literature review of the cited papers has been performed in the following manner: 'The induction motors (IMs) account for 80% of industrial motors because of its simple structure and low manufacture cost [7-9]. However, IMs have the secondary copper loss which is typically 25% of the total loss [10]. This secondary copper loss limits the efficiency improvement of IMs. Therefore, in order to replace IMs, new types of motor are being studied to improve the efficiency [11-14]. Synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) receive the attention as the alternative to IMs because SynRM don\u2019t have the secondary copper loss [11, 15]. Moreover, because of a greater saliency ratio, SynRM can produce a large reluctance torque when using  a variable speed drive or electronic controller [10, 16-18]. [\u2026] For this reason, line start synchronous reluctance motor (LS-SynRM) has received attention that it can operate at synchronous speed without the inverter [19-21].' (Lines 42-53). I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 15 (like the authors have did) or even more scientific works in a few lines just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section.

By doing so, the problem will be put into context and it will benefit the readers as well.
