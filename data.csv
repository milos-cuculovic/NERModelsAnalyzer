Critical accounts should also be discussed (Current Opinion in Chemical Engineering 2011, 1, 77-83).	{"163, 169, MODAL","7, 13, LOCATION","14, 20, MODAL","145, 162, CONTENT","189, 243, CONTENT","178, 187, ACTION","54, 58, ACTION","21, 25, ACTION","26, 48, CONTENT","82, 143, CONTENT"}
6103	2. Bulk referencing should be avoided , e.g. [2-5], [14-23] etc. A review article is not the same as a compilation of literature.

6108	7. In the review the authors should mention the use of software-assisted experimental design of membranes and membrane systems to encourage their use, which does not require extensive theoretical knowledge of the field and can be easily employed  by industrial professionals as well; and give some recent filtration examples from the membrane literature using design of experiments (DoE) optimization approach: ACS Catal., 2018, 8, 7430-7438; J.

6138	The manuscript by Chae and co-workers discusses the isolation and formulation of 1D niobium selenide crystals. The topic is of interest to a broad audience, however the potential impact needs to be emphasized. The manuscript reads well, and the conclusions are supported by experimental evidence.

6141	3. Avoid grouping references, e.g. [1-5], [6-10], [11-23], instead discuss them individually if they are relevant for the manuscript, or if the statement is general then a single book chapter or review article should be cited .	{"35, 40, LOCATION","42, 48, LOCATION","170, 209, CONTENT","3, 8, ACTION","50, 57, LOCATION","210, 216, MODAL","18, 28, CONTENT","219, 225, ACTION"}

6145	7. The rationale behind the selection of the solvents should be mentioned . Were they randomly selected? In such an extensive study, the authors could have considered including  some green solvents, especially from the class of alcohols, which seem to work the best based on the results. The authors should refer to book chapter 3.15, Organic Solvents in Sustainable Synthesis and Engineering, Green Chemistry – An Inclusive Approach, 2018, 513-553 (Elsevier) as a guideline for solvent selection.	{"316, 459, CONTENT","3, 53, CONTENT","54, 60, MODAL","64, 73, ACTION","76, 80, TRIGGER","81, 103, CONTENT","145, 155, MODAL","167, 176, ACTION","183, 197, CONTENT","210, 236, CONTENT","279, 286, LOCATION","300, 306, MODAL","307, 312, ACTION","479, 496, CONTENT"}

6148	10. The work used 16 conventional solvents and many of them are undesirable for toxicity and environmental reasons. The authors should mention in a sentence that solvent consumption should be minimized  in order to increase the sustainability of the process via sustainable membrane-based recovery (ACS Catal., 2018, 8, 7430–7438; ACS Sustainable Chem.

6207	The manuscript by Chun and co-workers describes a fouling and scaling study on FO membranes. There is a need for such research and the obtained results are of interest to a broad audience working in water purification, and membranes. The topic fits well within the scope of the journal.

6209	2, The main text under the ‘results and discussion’ is unnecessarily wordy. Shorten the text and minimize the discussion and reference to literature in this section as the ‘results and discussion’ should focus on the results obtained by the authors.

6216	The manuscript entitled“Ferroportin-hepcidin axis in prepubertal obese children with sufficient daily iron intake” presents  interesting issue, but the study itself has a number of serious limitations, significantly decreasing the quality of the study and reducing the possibility to conclude.	{"4, 14, LOCATION","144, 147, TRIGGER","23, 114, LOCATION","169, 200, CONTENT"}
6219	It seems, that Authors are not fluent English speakers as some sentences are hard to follow and some grammar issues must be corrected  (e.g. line 52 it should be“known”).The manuscript should be corrected  by native English speaker or maybe by the professional agency.	{"185, 191, MODAL","161, 168, CONTENT","141, 148, LOCATION","124, 133, ACTION","116, 120, MODAL","101, 115, CONTENT","77, 91, ACTION","195, 204, ACTION","174, 184, LOCATION"}

6261	The major problem with the presented manuscript is associated with the fact, that Author presents a kind of technical report only, that is not prepared according to the commonly applied rules for scientific paper. Author must be aware that even if he has interesting  idea and valuable results, he can not just present them without a proper justification, discussion, and conclusions. The contribution valuable for readers must be presented  in a proper form – according to the generally applied scheme of the scientific paper. Without it, it is just a technical report from the study and should not be published .	{"431, 440, ACTION","385, 422, CONTENT","298, 318, ACTION","221, 225, MODAL","334, 383, CONTENT","226, 234, ACTION","37, 47, LOCATION","474, 526, CONTENT","423, 427, MODAL"}

6281	The manuscript evaluates the treatment of wastewater in China over the period 2011-2015. It uses a statistical model (Directional Distance Function) to determine the efficiency of inputs and outputs such as GDP, wastewater and expense efficiency. The study is comprehensive; drawing conclusions from data gathered over 31 different regions across China. Based on their findings, the authors give critical recommendations about actions which could be taken. The article fits well into the scope of Applied Sciences and could be further considered  for publication after major alterations.	{"4, 14, LOCATION"}
6282	1. When stating the input and output variables in Table 1, the authors should explain the parentheses/units and what these refer to (e.g. Population (10,000 persons)). These units on all efficiencies should be made clear before the explanations that follow in Section 4.2.	{"210, 220, ACTION","50, 57, LOCATION","138, 165, LOCATION","71, 77, MODAL","78, 85, ACTION","86, 107, CONTENT","112, 116, TRIGGER","117, 131, CONTENT","260, 271, LOCATION","200, 206, MODAL","168, 199, CONTENT"}
6283	2. The presentation of data tables should be made neater before publication. As some tables’ present data for 31 regions, these contain lots of information and appear cluttered. The authors could separate regions by gridlines in the tables, making it easier for the reader to visualise.	{"233, 239, LOCATION","205, 225, CONTENT","196, 204, ACTION","190, 195, MODAL","85, 91, LOCATION","45, 49, ACTION","35, 41, MODAL","57, 75, CONTENT","23, 34, LOCATION"}
6284	3. Table 8 should be restructured . It can be seen the heading Rank is sometimes spread over two rows. This appears untidy and should be corrected  prior to publication.	{"103, 107, CONTENT","51, 101, CONTENT","21, 33, ACTION","11, 17, MODAL","137, 146, ACTION","3, 10, LOCATION","127, 133, MODAL"}
6285	4. For all of the efficiency graphs (Figures 1 – 6), showing average values of various inputs and outputs, each data point should contain standard deviation (or error bars) about these mean values for each year. These would make the figures more information rich and give an idea to the reader regarding  the spread of results about the mean. It should also be stated explicitly how these errors were calculated. As the study is based on a theoretical model, the more statistical analysis that can be presented  in the figures would be beneficial to the manuscript.	{"107, 122, CONTENT","123, 129, MODAL","459, 488, CONTENT","138, 210, CONTENT","361, 367, ACTION","379, 382, TRIGGER","383, 411, CONTENT","233, 240, LOCATION","346, 352, MODAL","130, 137, ACTION","493, 497, MODAL","501, 510, ACTION","519, 526, LOCATION","554, 564, LOCATION","37, 50, LOCATION","18, 35, LOCATION"}
6286	5. In Section 4.2.2, the author(s) make statements such as: The COD of all regions are all above 0.6534. The author(s) should provide some benchmark values, putting these results into context as to what constitutes a good efficiency score. This could be done by referencing existing literature or modelling  efficiency scores over the previous 10 years in China for comparison. This would help the reader to immediately determine the performance of wastewater treatment compared to similar works.	{"244, 250, MODAL","308, 361, CONTENT","297, 306, ACTION","274, 293, CONTENT","262, 273, ACTION","6, 19, LOCATION","60, 103, LOCATION","119, 125, MODAL","126, 133, ACTION","139, 238, CONTENT","251, 258, ACTION"}
6287	6. Recent efforts on the wastewater treatment area in China should be acknowledged : Water Res., 2018, 130, 38-46; J. Hazard. Mater., 2018, 354, 81-90.	{"70, 82, ACTION","3, 59, CONTENT","60, 66, MODAL","85, 150, CONTENT"}
6288	7. The author(s) are inconsistent in describing the efficiencies. For example in Section 4.2.2 the author(s) state 0.6556 and 7438. The efficiencies should have a maximum value of 1 and these misquotations of results in the text should be corrected  prior to publication.	{"132, 148, CONTENT","81, 94, LOCATION","115, 121, LOCATION","126, 130, LOCATION","149, 155, MODAL","156, 160, ACTION","161, 181, CONTENT","192, 216, CONTENT","224, 228, LOCATION","229, 235, MODAL","239, 248, ACTION"}
6289	8. In Table 2, it should be made clearer how the Rate (%) is determined (bottom row). It is unclear whether this refers to the duration over which this rate is determined. This should be described  in the table or main body of the text.	{"100, 170, CONTENT","6, 13, LOCATION","18, 24, MODAL","28, 40, ACTION","41, 44, TRIGGER","45, 84, CONTENT","172, 176, CONTENT","177, 183, MODAL","187, 196, ACTION","204, 210, LOCATION","214, 223, LOCATION","89, 99, ACTION","231, 235, LOCATION"}
6290	9. Given the global trend toward sustainable solutions, the authors should write a short paragraph in the introduction, and mention the importance and need for sustainable solutions for various applications among them water treatment, and give some diverse examples such desalination (Green Chem., 2018, 20, 3689-3695); wastewater treatment (Green Chem., 2015, 17, 5196-5205); water management (J. Clean. Product., 2018, 172, 786-794); catalysis (ACS Catal., 2018, 8, 7430-7438); extraction (J. Clean.

6291	10. The author(s) frequently refer to the‘5-Year Plan’ throughout the text. It should be stated what this refers to in the introduction, outlining the goals and origin of the plan.

6300	1. Only 0.3 wt% DA was present in the membrane? The authors should also quantify the amount of the DA used during  the membrane preparation and express its incorporation into the membrane. It seems that most of the DA remains in solution and does not for part of the membrane.

6301	2. The experimental description for the TFC membrane (section 2.3) is not clearly explained. A table should be included  with all the components and relevant information for each membrane.

6308	The manuscript by Terraza et al. describes the effect of nanoparticles on PVDF-based mixed matrix membranes. The manuscript is well written, it has a good amount of data presented, and it is of interest to a broad audience working as materials scientists, polymer chemists or chemical engineers. The discussions and the data are of good quality. The work is novel and has a potential to be published in polymers subject to addressing the following concerns:	{"434, 456, CONTENT","113, 123, LOCATION","300, 311, LOCATION","320, 324, LOCATION","423, 433, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION"}

6310	2. The MMM preparation is somewhat unclear. The 2-10 wt.% refers to the solid content of the final membrane, or the entire dope solution comprising of the polymer, NP and solvent?

6311	3. A more elaborate explanation should be provided on the observation that the NPs are preferably located  in the bulk and not the surface (paragraph 231). Is there a sufficient adhesion of the NPs to the polymer matrix? Are the NPs breaking off the surface? These problems often seen for MMMs when rigid fillers are used. A crosslinking solution has been proposed to achieve robust MMMs, which should be mentioned  by the authors (ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 2018, 10, 16140-16147).	{"75, 138, CONTENT","432, 482, CONTENT","405, 414, ACTION","395, 401, MODAL","323, 387, CONTENT","225, 257, CONTENT","221, 224, TRIGGER","165, 219, CONTENT","140, 153, LOCATION","156, 158, TRIGGER","3, 31, CONTENT","32, 38, MODAL","42, 50, ACTION"}

6321	The manuscript entitled“The Role of Foods as Dietary Sources of Vitamin D for Ethnic Minority Populations: The Underestimated Challenge” presents interesting issue, but some really major  corrections are needed.	{"23, 136, LOCATION","169, 199, CONTENT","204, 210, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION","165, 168, TRIGGER"}
6323	Authors improperly formulated the title and the aim, while compared with the main body of the study, as there seem to be a misunderstanding of some definitions. Authors use the terms such as“ethnic populations”/“ethnic minority”, while they state that there is a problem“due to the skin pigment melanin and/or reduced skin exposure due to coverage required by religious and cultural restrictions”. But the definition of“ethnic populations”/“ethnic minority” is different and incomparable with those applied by Authors. The“ethnic group” is defined as a group of people with the common nation, ancestry, history, language, culture, society, while“ethnic minority” is defined as a group of people with common nation, ancestry, etc., that is different from the majority of population.	{"419, 439, LOCATION","522, 536, LOCATION","645, 662, LOCATION","8, 29, ACTION","34, 39, LOCATION","48, 51, LOCATION","77, 86, LOCATION","190, 210, LOCATION","211, 228, LOCATION","270, 396, LOCATION","398, 401, TRIGGER","440, 457, LOCATION"}
6324	So, Authors must understand, that“skin pigment melanin and/or reduced skin exposure due to coverage required by religious and cultural restrictions” is typical for only SOME of minorities – e.g. Malaysian minority in Great Britain. But for the British minority in Malaysia, there is totally different problem (e.g. resulting from lack of traditional British products being sources of vitamin D).	{"12, 16, MODAL","232, 235, TRIGGER","17, 27, ACTION","33, 148, LOCATION"}
6325	It seems, that Authors aimed to assess the minorities in western countries, but is also not so simple, as for French minority in Great Britain the indicated problems also do not exist. So maybe Authors wanted to assess just Middle East, Asian and African minorities? If so, there is not adequate information in the study.	{"315, 320, LOCATION","209, 265, CONTENT","280, 286, ACTION","287, 307, CONTENT"}
6326	Authors must verify their approach and reformulate their thesis in order to be in agreement with the general definitions. Lack of a broader international perspective and perceiving only the own point of view seem as a lack of political correctness. It should be re-analyzed not only due to communicativeness of the study, but also due to presenting improper beliefs and opinions (western people are ALSO minorities if changing the country).	{"252, 258, MODAL","249, 251, CONTENT","262, 273, ACTION","8, 12, MODAL","13, 19, ACTION","20, 34, CONTENT","39, 50, ACTION","51, 63, CONTENT"}
