The other months are then used for the UPP training. Although in a real application future data cannot be used  as learning support for present schedule planning (e.g. using 2018 data as training for 2017 operation), the setups used here aim to test ALFRED’s learning effectiveness for an entire year."

"Theory of convexity plays a strong role in the field of fractional integral inequalities due to the behavior of its definition. There is a strong relationship between convexity and symmetry theories. Whichever one we work on, we can apply it to the other one due the strong correlation produced between them, especially in the past few years."

Due to the 361 restricted development of ecological public welfare forests, forestry income has dropped sharply, and 362 the livelihoods and sustainable improvements of forest farmers have been affected. Although the 363 government has implemented ecological compensation, the compensation standards are low, and the 364 value of natural capital cannot be realized , which has led to the frustration of land contract right 365 holders regarding participation.”

This paper proposes a scheme for building a Distributed Geo-Resource Sharing Library with 490 photo modeling technology. Compared with the traditional way of collecting specimens and taking 491 photos, this system reduces the waste of resources and money. It increases the effective learning time 492 for students, improves the learning quality in the uneven education area, and guarantees a fair and 493 sustainable development of geoscience education.”
