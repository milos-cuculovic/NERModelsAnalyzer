{"text":"The manuscript entitled“Analysis of the effects of dietary pattern on the oral microbiome of elite endurance athletes” presents interesting issue, but some corrections are still needed, as Authors did not correct the previously indicated problems.Major problem:The major problem in the presented study is the fact that participants were assigned to a specific diet base on their own choice “according to their beliefs in the potential effect on their performance”). Authors answered this issue but they did not specify it in their manuscript. Such choice is a very important bias, as the choice is neither random nor based on any criteria.

As I stated previously, Authors should present (1) nutritional value (not only macronutrients), (2) content of products from a specific groupsResults:The characteristics of the studied group should be presented  – especially ethnicity, but also other factors, e.g. gender, BMI, age, previous diet, etc. – it should be presented  as mean (BMI) or share of a group (ethnicity), not as a detailed characteristics of each participant separately and it should be transferred  from supplementary material to the main body of the study.Discussion:Authors should extensively discuss the possible reasons of their observations, while they should relate the discussion to very specific results that were observed and the fact that it was assessed exactly in athletes.Authors should extensively discuss the limitations of the study associated with the conducted study (e.g. method of diet assessment, etc.) and with the concluding (e.g. possibility to conclude on the basis of conducted research, the choice of diet by participants).Authors should formulate the conclusions from their study – real are needed – currently the only conclusion is“to further investigate”.

The context of the work should be set first. What scientific problems and questions the work try to address?3. The scale bars on the SEM images should be visible. The resolution is too low to be able to see what length the scale bar actually represents.4. Reproducibility should be discussed . Were the catalysts prepared and tested several times? Standard deviations for the obtained data should be presented where possible, in particular Figures 9-10 where the CO conversion is presented.5. Closely related work on CO oxidation should be mentioned  in the introduction such as 10.3390/catal9030256; 10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.10.015; 10.1021/jacs.7b13624 (DOI).6. CO oxidation (in particular at low temperature) is pivotal to the abatement of exhaust gases and therefore ties in well with the increasingly important sustainability efforts in catalysis. A general paragraph on sustainability should be added  to the introduction. Briefly mention the different fields of sustainable solutions via catalysis such as biorefinery (10.1039/C8GC04017F), organocatalysis (10.1021/acscatal.8b01706), waste valorization (10.1039/C9GC00902G), hydrogen evolution (10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b05302), natural laterite (10.1021/acsanm.8b01117).7. The catalysts were washed with isopropanol. The amount expressed as “L solvent per kg catalyst” should be explicitly given under the experimental section. The scale of catalyst fabrication should also be revealed as currently the exact amounts are not disclosed under section 4.1.8. The recovery and reusability of the catalysts should be discussed  in the text. Have the authors performed any repeated experiments on used catalysts? Have they observed any performance decline? What are the criteria for reusing the catalysts? What is the expected lifetime of the catalysts?9. In order to minimize waste and address the sustainability requirements, the authors should mention that the isopropanol could be recycled  using sustainable membrane technologies (solvent recycling) and mention 10.1016/j.jcat.2019.01.041 example.10. The conclusion section should briefly mention the main limitations and drawbacks of the proposed catalysts, as well as the novelty of the presented work in relation to the existing literature.11.

Population based evolutionary approaches, such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs) or Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), are able to detect in a fast way the main regions of attraction while their local search abilities represent a major drawback [11] from the point of view of the solution accuracy and of the convergence behaviour, specially when applied to multimodal problems.

Used in other different fields [23]-[25], first proposed by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997) [26], this experimental data is a chaotic time series, which is closely related to time in prediction. LSTM has been widely applied in many field, especially in time series modeling, including speech recognition, natural language processing and sequence prediction [27]-[28].\" I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 13 (like the authors did) or even more scientific works in a few lines just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section.

{"text":"Ø Lines 63-73, the \"Introduction\" section. \"Several studies have focused on the wintertime elevated PM2.5 (Baasandorj et al., 2017; Bares et al., 2018) and summertime elevated ozone (Horel et al., 2016; Lareau et al., 2012) levels in the Salt Lake Valley. Using a state-of-the-art mobile observation platform that includes instrumentation mounted on light rail trains (Mitchell et al., 2018) and a news helicopter (Blaylock, Horel, & Crosman, 2017), large spatial and temporal gradients in pollutant concentrations have been observed across Salt Lake County. The health impacts of poor air quality in Utah range from high incidences of pneumonia (Pirozzi et al., 2018), to increased hospitalizations due to respiratory issues (Horne et al., 2018). Furthermore, emerging associations between poor air quality and negative health outcomes such as pre-term births (Hackmann & Sjöberg, 2016) and suicides (Bakian et al., 2015) have been found in the Salt Lake Valley and Utah, furthering the importance of pollutant reduction strategies.\" I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 10 (like the authors have did) or even more scientific works in a few lines just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section.

Several factors may have contributed to this result, including: the distance of UCE pilot event locations from public transit, the lack of culturally relevant messaging, the lack of Spanish-speaking staff at events, and the lack of trusted messengers participating in events. To address the lack of demographic representation among participants, subsequent expansion efforts should include more direct engagement with trusted members of the targeted communities and stronger attempts to engage participants in energy efficiency education.\". It is beneficial for this study the fact that the authors have admitted their failure to attract demographically representative participants in their study, have analyzed possible reasons that have caused and potential ways to address this lack in the future, but I consider that the authors must explain if this failure did not affect the relevance of their study.

I do not contradict the value of these papers, or their relevance in this context, but I consider that the article under review will benefit if the authors extend this section by analyzing appropriately the cited papers and by analyzing  more other papers in order to contextualize their study. The literature review of the cited papers has been performed mostly in the following manner: \"Membrane separation is another method has been used for natural gas sweetening [7-10]. Other methods include but are not limited to biochemical method [11], molecular sieving [12,13], and low-temperature fractionation [14,15]. Among those technologies listed above, chemical absorption is the most widely used method for acid gas removal. Various amines have been commonly used as chemical solvents, such as monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), and methyldiethanolamine (MDEA). Compared with MEA and DEA, MDEA can selectively remove H2S with the existence of CO2. Secondly, MDEA can remove most CO2 and H2S from the raw natural gas, it can be beneficial to sulfur recovery. Thirdly, the foaming tendency and corrosiveness of MDEA are lower compared to MEA and DEA. Last but not least, the reaction of MDEA with CO2 is an acid-base reaction with less heat of reaction, thus less heat is needed during regeneration, so it is ideal for removing CO2 in large quantities [16-18].\". I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 12 (like the authors have did) or even more scientific works in a few lines just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section.

On the basis of load characteristics’ analysis for e-bus charging station, FC is adopted to extract samples on similar days, which can not only avoid the blindness of selecting  similar days by experience, but also overcome the adverse effects of unconventional load data caused by sudden change of factors on training. Then, the author employs WPA with good global convergence and computational robustness in order to optimize the parameters of LSSVM. Consequently, in the paper is developed a hybrid load forecasting model for quick-change e-bus charging station, namely FC-WPA-LSSVM.

It can be characterized  by many software attributes [1–7], which are referred to as trustworthy attributes. Software trustworthiness measurement describes how to determine the trustworthy degree of software based on the given trustworthy attributes’ values and their weight values. It can provide a basis for guiding and improving  the trustworthiness of design and implementation of software. Therefore, software trustworthiness measurement becomes one of the core scientific problems in the researching on software trustworthiness [1]. Many software trustworthiness measures based on trustworthy attributes are established, including questionnaires and statistical analysis [8,9], axiomatic approaches [10–16], evidence theory [17], supervised machine learning [18], maximum entropy and grey decision-making method [19], software behaviour entropy [20], system testing [21], social-to-software framework [22], crowd wisdom [23], heuristic-systematic processing model [24], users feedback [25], STRAM (Security, Trust, Resilience, and Agility Metrics) [26], etc.\" I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 26 (like the authors have did) or even more scientific works in a few lines just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section.

The literature review of the cited papers has been performed in the following manner: \"The induction motors (IMs) account for 80% of industrial motors because of its simple structure and low manufacture cost [7-9]. However, IMs have the secondary copper loss which is typically 25% of the total loss [10]. This secondary copper loss limits the efficiency improvement of IMs. Therefore, in order to replace IMs, new types of motor are being studied to improve the efficiency [11-14]. Synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) receive the attention as the alternative to IMs because SynRM don’t have the secondary copper loss [11, 15]. Moreover, because of a greater saliency ratio, SynRM can produce a large reluctance torque when using  a variable speed drive or electronic controller [10, 16-18]. […] For this reason, line start synchronous reluctance motor (LS-SynRM) has received attention that it can operate at synchronous speed without the inverter [19-21].\" (Lines 42-53).

The literature review of the cited papers has been performed in the following manner: \"A significant part of these systems in the EU, and most of them in Poland, are extremely worn-out [1–3]. They are not efficient and produce considerable amounts of impurities and pollutants which have a negative effect on the environment [4,5]. […] They do not reduce emission of pollutants generated by technological systems of heat sources [6,7]. […] Solutions with recuperators can include devices installed as separate elements of the technological system of the heat source [8–11] or devices which constitute an integral part of the combustion chamber, e.g., in condensing boilers [11,12]. Recently, systems with compressor or sorption heat pumps for the recovery and reuse of waste heat have been used most frequently [13,14]. An interesting concept of using an adsorption heat pump for reusing the heat generated by a district heating system in the summer period, when the heat is treated as waste heat, was discussed in [15]. However, the solutions for heat recovery with the use of recuperators and/or heat pumps do not in any way affect changes in the combustion gas composition, thus they do not contribute to the reduction of environmental burden caused by heat sources. This is a serious disadvantage of these solutions in comparison to the installation described herein, which enhances energy efficiency of boilers and reduces emission of pollutants and impurities, including solid impurities. Methods of improving control systems in heating boilers are also often applied in order to enhance energy efficiency of heat sources [16–19]. […] This has a negative effect on the costs and time required for the modernization of control systems [20–22].\" (Lines 17-42).

The Regulation was published in the EU’s Official Journal on 25th July 2015 and entered into effect on 14th August 2015. The Regulation has created a comprehensive legal framework for electricity trading in Europe and has made so-called 'market coupling' legally binding across the EU. The Regulation is part of the Commission's project to create an Energy Union with a truly integrated electricity market. These rules establish a new decision-making procedure which enables effective regional cooperation among grid operators, power exchanges and regulators.
