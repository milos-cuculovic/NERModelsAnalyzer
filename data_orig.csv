5893	The manuscript by Arias et al. details the design of a membrane cascade for gas separation. The work has some novelty, it has a good amount of data, and the topic is of interest to a broad audience including chemical engineers, process engineers and professionals working in the membrane field. The work fits well the scope of the journal. However, there are several issues that must be addressed  prior to further consideration by Processes. The manuscript needs to be reconsidered after carefully addressing all the comments listed below:	{"359, 373, CONTENT","379, 383, MODAL","387, 396, ACTION","447, 457, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","386, 396, ACTION","379, 383, MODAL","340, 347, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","340, 347, TRIGGER"}

5902	9) The accuracy of the applied methods as well as the obtained numerical results should be thought through and considered  in the presentation of data. For instance, when 75.95% is reported, is it appropriate to report percentages down to two decimal places? The accuracy should not be more than a percent.	{"272, 278, MODAL","191, 257, CONTENT","171, 177, LOCATION","91, 106, ACTION","111, 123, ACTION","130, 150, LOCATION","90, 121, ACTION","81, 87, MODAL","166, 170, TRIGGER","3, 80, CONTENT","81, 88, MODAL","166, 170, TRIGGER","279, 295, ACTION","296, 305, CONTENT"}

5906	13) In general it is difficult to follow the manuscript because the components of the system such as membranes, pumps etc are not numbered and abbreviated appropriately. Introduce a system that is consistent throughout the text and the figures to help guiding the readers.	{"223, 228, LOCATION","170, 180, ACTION","45, 56, LOCATION","180, 207, CONTENT","236, 244, LOCATION","45, 55, LOCATION"}

5908	The manuscript entitled“Association of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration with pulmonary function in young adults” presents very interesting issue and it should be published , but a number of important corrections are previously needed.	{"181, 184, TRIGGER","23, 119, LOCATION","181, 184, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","168, 178, ACTION","159, 165, MODAL","4, 14, LOCATION"}

5912	Due to the fact, that the study is rather short, there is no need to exclude some tables from the study and present them as a supplementary material – Authors should rather include them into main body of the study, to be easier to follow (Table S1 – into Materials and Methods section, Tables S2-S4 – into Results section).	{"286, 298, LOCATION","159, 165, MODAL","82, 88, LOCATION","191, 213, LOCATION","77, 125, CONTENT","126, 148, LOCATION","173, 181, ACTION","159, 166, MODAL","58, 65, MODAL","69, 77, ACTION","306, 321, LOCATION","255, 284, LOCATION","239, 247, LOCATION"}

5916	Line 70 – it seems that the 3rd evaluation was conducted in 2011-2013 (not separately in 2011 and 2013), so it should not be indicated “participants were on average 17 and 21 years of age, respectively”, but that they“were on average 17-21 years of age”	{"217, 253, CONTENT","135, 202, LOCATION","111, 121, MODAL","125, 134, ACTION","204, 207, TRIGGER","204, 207, TRIGGER","111, 117, MODAL","124, 134, ACTION","0, 7, LOCATION","0, 8, LOCATION"}

5919	Section 2.1. – Authors should specify their inclusion and exclusion criteria – it seems that pregnant ones were excluded, but who else (e.g. Any diseases that disturb vitamin D metabolism? Any diseases that limit the sunlight exposure? Any diseases that change the general diet? etc.)	{"0, 11, LOCATION","145, 187, CONTENT","236, 240, TRIGGER","122, 125, TRIGGER","141, 144, TRIGGER","126, 134, CONTENT","240, 277, CONTENT","23, 37, ACTION","0, 12, LOCATION","23, 30, MODAL","189, 193, TRIGGER","30, 38, ACTION","38, 76, CONTENT","193, 234, CONTENT","122, 125, TRIGGER"}

5924	Line 125-126 – are Authors sure, that they measured height“in centimeters to the nearest tenth” (not in millimeters to the nearest tenth) and weight“in kilograms to the nearest tenth”? It means, that e.g. 174 cm and 56 kg were interpreted as 170 cm and 60 kg  - it may result in a serious error.

5926	It seems, that Authors did not verify the normality of distribution for the assessed variables. Authors must verify the normality of distribution and specify the test applied for verification. Afterwards, for non-parametric distributions, rather median with min and max values should be presented , not mean and SD, while the tests applied for comparison also must be corrected  accordingly.	{"287, 297, ACTION","368, 379, ACTION","277, 284, MODAL","120, 191, CONTENT","109, 116, ACTION","104, 109, MODAL","322, 354, CONTENT","277, 283, MODAL","209, 237, CONTENT","104, 115, ACTION","193, 203, TRIGGER","360, 365, MODAL"}

5928	While classifying results for the season, Authors applied the broad range for sunny season (March – October) – it must be justified for Portugal or recalculated  for the more reasonable range while the sunlight exposure is sufficient to obtain the vitamin D skin synthesis.	{"122, 131, ACTION","121, 160, ACTION","114, 118, MODAL","114, 119, MODAL","198, 272, CONTENT","192, 197, TRIGGER","162, 191, CONTENT","132, 144, CONTENT","50, 108, CONTENT","0, 5, TRIGGER","148, 160, ACTION","145, 147, TRIGGER"}
5929	Table 3 – Authors should consider changing  table in order to have the pulmonary function parameters in the first column (to add the column for this parameter), instead of presenting them in rows – to obtain a better readability	{"62, 100, CONTENT","108, 120, LOCATION","161, 171, TRIGGER","18, 25, MODAL","129, 158, CONTENT","44, 49, LOCATION","125, 129, ACTION","0, 7, LOCATION","24, 42, ACTION","172, 187, CONTENT","191, 195, LOCATION","201, 207, ACTION","210, 228, CONTENT","0, 7, LOCATION","25, 42, ACTION","50, 61, TRIGGER"}
5930	The main weakness of the study is associated with the fact, that Authors did not assess the vitamin D dietary intake and they did not adjust their results of vitamin D serum concentration for vitamin D intake. As they adjusted it for season (the most important factor influencing vitamin D status), they should also have adjusted it for vitamin D intake. The vitamin D intake may be for individuals characterized  by high fish intake even more important than sunlight exposure, so especially for Portugal (characterized by quite high fish intake) – this assessment may be very important. If Authors do not have such results, they should discuss it extensively and indicate it as a possible problem and a reason of lack of significant association (as it was not included into adjustment).	{"147, 208, CONTENT","673, 675, CONTENT","645, 647, CONTENT","591, 623, CONTENT","588, 590, TRIGGER","311, 315, TRIGGER","9, 17, ACTION","25, 30, LOCATION","304, 310, MODAL","73, 87, ACTION","126, 140, ACTION","88, 116, CONTENT","304, 310, MODAL","316, 329, ACTION","333, 353, CONTENT","630, 636, MODAL","637, 644, ACTION","664, 672, ACTION","678, 745, CONTENT","382, 412, ACTION"}

5936	7) The introduction discusses some of the existing literature on the topic but lacks a discussion on the need and novelty of the research presented by the authors in the submitted manuscript. The latter one should be linked to the presented  literature.	{"207, 214, MODAL","85, 137, CONTENT","7, 19, LOCATION","180, 190, LOCATION","216, 240, ACTION","7, 19, LOCATION","227, 252, CONTENT","217, 226, ACTION","79, 84, ACTION","192, 206, CONTENT","75, 78, TRIGGER","207, 213, MODAL","75, 78, TRIGGER"}

5938	11) It is not clear why Figure 5(i) and 5(ii) need to be presented.

5941	The manuscript by Kudlek describes the decomposition of contaminants in oxidation processes. The results are of interest to the readers of the journal, however the presentation must be improved . The manuscript is provides a good comparison of catalysts and processes but further clarification are needed. The context/background of the manuscript also needs to be improved.

6012	5) The Introduction should include a critical statement about the existing cadmium scavenging  technologies to verify the need for the presented work. What are the problems with the current adsorbents? Why/how will be the new adsorbent in this paper better than those?	{"7, 19, LOCATION","210, 267, CONTENT","202, 209, TRIGGER","159, 200, CONTENT","151, 156, TRIGGER","37, 107, CONTENT","7, 20, LOCATION","27, 35, ACTION","20, 27, MODAL","151, 155, TRIGGER","210, 214, MODAL","26, 93, ACTION"}
6013	6) The numbers in chemical formulas should be written in subscript, e.g.“CdCl2” should be corrected  to“CdCl2”.	{"57, 66, CONTENT","80, 87, MODAL","90, 101, ACTION","72, 79, LOCATION","3, 35, CONTENT","103, 110, CONTENT","36, 43, MODAL","46, 54, ACTION","36, 42, MODAL","89, 99, ACTION","72, 79, LOCATION"}
6014	7) Instead of“et al.” the authors should use“etc.” to express the non-exhaustiveness of a list, e.g. Lines 35, 55, 151	{"54, 62, ACTION","66, 94, CONTENT","41, 44, ACTION","34, 41, MODAL","101, 118, LOCATION","13, 21, LOCATION","34, 44, ACTION","44, 50, CONTENT","13, 21, LOCATION","3, 10, TRIGGER"}
6015	8) The Experimental description should be more detailed . For instance, what was the concentration and volume of the concentrated hydrochloric acid in the desorption experiment? Were the three-times repeated experiments performed with independently prepared adsorbents or with the same batch of adsorbent?	{"72, 76, TRIGGER","41, 55, ACTION","77, 81, TRIGGER","32, 39, MODAL","3, 31, CONTENT","187, 304, CONTENT","178, 183, TRIGGER","84, 176, CONTENT","47, 56, ACTION","32, 38, MODAL"}
6016	9) A large part of the experimental data is presented with more significant figures than that of the accuracy of the technique would justify. Revise and correct the accuracy of these data (E.g. IR wavenumbers, Kd, k, ?, temperature, ?G, ?H, ?S, qe, desorption ratio, adsorption capacity decrease).	{"142, 149, ACTION","161, 187, CONTENT","76, 83, LOCATION","127, 140, ACTION","194, 295, CONTENT","153, 161, ACTION"}
6017	12) The panels of figures should be better organised . Please present the panels of Fig. 2 in 2x2 while the panels of Fig. 4 next to each other (1x2).	{"26, 33, MODAL","125, 149, CONTENT","108, 124, LOCATION","94, 97, CONTENT","18, 25, LOCATION","35, 52, ACTION","26, 32, MODAL","7, 25, LOCATION","43, 53, ACTION","62, 70, ACTION","74, 90, LOCATION"}
6018	14) Line 40:“Among all the heavy metal ions, cadmium was listed as the sixth most poisonous substance” This statement should be supported  by a relevant reference. There is no such statement in the article cited: Das et al., 1997.	{"118, 125, MODAL","144, 162, CONTENT","213, 229, CONTENT","4, 11, LOCATION","12, 102, LOCATION","127, 137, ACTION","118, 124, MODAL","103, 117, CONTENT","198, 205, LOCATION","4, 11, LOCATION","128, 139, ACTION"}
6019	15) Cadmium should be written in lower case without italic style.	{"44, 64, ACTION","12, 18, MODAL","12, 19, MODAL","4, 11, LOCATION","22, 43, ACTION"}
6020	16) In Lines 224-227, the authors explain why the Langmuir and Freundlich models are not adequate to study adsorption in solid-liquid systems. What is the rationale behind performing these analyses? Furthermore, the thermodynamic parameters derived from Langmuir and SDT-A models should be compared and the difference should be discussed .	{"328, 338, ACTION","143, 148, TRIGGER","7, 20, LOCATION","199, 210, TRIGGER","143, 147, TRIGGER","303, 317, CONTENT","280, 287, MODAL","318, 325, MODAL","216, 279, CONTENT","280, 286, MODAL","289, 337, ACTION","7, 20, LOCATION","290, 299, ACTION","151, 197, CONTENT"}
6021	17) Lines 253-260. This paragraph is confusing and difficult to follow, and needs to be rephrased.	{"88, 97, ACTION","19, 33, LOCATION","4, 17, LOCATION","76, 82, MODAL","4, 17, LOCATION"}
6022	18) Correct“kJmol” to“kJ/mol” everywhere in the footnote of Table 3.	{"21, 29, CONTENT","4, 11, ACTION","47, 56, LOCATION","60, 67, LOCATION","11, 18, LOCATION","11, 18, LOCATION"}
6023	20) Line 109:“The pH of Cd(II) solution was adjusted to the range of 2.0-10.0” -> This information seems erroneous as in Fig. 4, pH values from 1.5 to 13 are depicted.	{"121, 127, LOCATION","4, 12, LOCATION","4, 12, LOCATION","13, 78, LOCATION","129, 166, CONTENT","82, 98, CONTENT","99, 114, ACTION","115, 117, TRIGGER"}
6024	21) Line 111:“the IB dosage changed from 1.0 to 10.0 g/L” -> This information seems erroneous as in Fig. S4, dosage values from 0.5 to 5.0 are depicted.	{"4, 12, LOCATION","61, 77, CONTENT","78, 93, ACTION","109, 151, CONTENT","100, 107, LOCATION","4, 12, LOCATION","13, 57, LOCATION"}
6025	22) Although the results of zeta potential analysis are briefly summarized, the relevance of this analysis in relation to the proposed application should be clarified . The relevant findings of this analysis should be discussed .	{"173, 207, CONTENT","147, 153, MODAL","80, 146, CONTENT","147, 154, MODAL","157, 167, ACTION","156, 166, ACTION","218, 228, ACTION","208, 215, MODAL"}
6026	23) Section 3.2 is titled“Adsorption experiment results” while Section 3.3 is“Adsorption experiment”. The division into sections should be revised : either specific and distinct titles should be given to these sections, or they should be merged .	{"195, 201, ACTION","4, 15, LOCATION","63, 74, LOCATION","129, 136, MODAL","139, 147, ACTION","185, 192, MODAL","149, 184, CONTENT","238, 245, ACTION","228, 235, MODAL","102, 128, CONTENT","220, 222, TRIGGER","210, 218, LOCATION","77, 100, LOCATION","25, 56, LOCATION","4, 15, LOCATION","138, 146, ACTION","129, 135, MODAL"}
6027	24) A section discussing the mathematical framework of this work should be created  in the Supporting Information. All the equations used for the fitting of different models should be introduced  in this section in the SI rather than under the Results and Discussion.	{"91, 113, LOCATION","115, 173, CONTENT","219, 221, LOCATION","184, 196, ACTION","65, 71, MODAL","204, 212, LOCATION","244, 266, LOCATION","174, 181, MODAL","256, 266, LOCATION","74, 82, ACTION","75, 84, ACTION","222, 233, TRIGGER","4, 64, CONTENT","65, 72, MODAL"}
6028	25) The unit of adsorption capacity should be corrected  from“mg/L” to“mg/g” in both Fig. 2a and 4a.	{"4, 35, CONTENT","61, 67, LOCATION","70, 76, CONTENT","45, 55, ACTION","61, 67, LOCATION","36, 43, MODAL","97, 99, LOCATION","36, 42, MODAL","85, 92, LOCATION","46, 57, ACTION"}
6029	26) Line 288:“The reduction of adsorption capacity may be due to the saturation of the adsorption active sites.” This statement seems erroneous. With higher adsorbent dosage more active sites are introduced thus the saturation of the adsorption active sites can be rejected . However, with higher adsorbent dosage more active sites compete for the same amount of Cd(II) ions therefore only the higher affinity active sites will be occupied  resulting in a decrease in adsorption capacity.	{"51, 54, MODAL","276, 283, TRIGGER","264, 273, ACTION","128, 143, ACTION","4, 12, LOCATION","375, 384, TRIGGER","4, 12, LOCATION","13, 112, LOCATION","276, 283, TRIGGER","113, 127, CONTENT"}
6030	27) Line 291:“From the aspects of economic, 2.0 g/L adsorbent was selected as the optimum dose.” -> How was the economically optimal dose determined? What were the economic factors taken into consideration? Please elaborate, and provide evidence for the“economic” nature of the work, or refrain from this statement.	{"150, 154, TRIGGER","237, 282, CONTENT","287, 295, ACTION","160, 205, CONTENT","4, 12, LOCATION","13, 96, LOCATION","100, 103, TRIGGER","108, 148, CONTENT","284, 286, TRIGGER","305, 314, CONTENT","100, 103, TRIGGER","214, 223, ACTION","229, 237, ACTION","4, 12, LOCATION"}
6031	28) At the end of Results and Discussion section, the adsorbent performance should be compared  to other similar adsorbents (imprinted or biochar based) from the literature.	{"50, 75, CONTENT","30, 40, LOCATION","85, 94, ACTION","76, 82, MODAL","86, 96, ACTION","18, 48, LOCATION","99, 172, CONTENT","76, 83, MODAL"}
6032	29) Reference 14. (Hou et al.) seems to be incorrect as it is not about biochar source or production, thus the reference should be removed .	{"121, 127, MODAL","121, 128, MODAL","131, 139, ACTION","19, 29, LOCATION","4, 16, LOCATION","4, 16, LOCATION","130, 138, ACTION","110, 120, CONTENT"}
6033	30) The referencing style should be uniform, revise and correct as necessary, e.g. full article names with capitals are used except“Braz.j.plant Physiol”,“Eur. J. Forest. Res.” and“Journal of geophysical research solid earth”.	{"4, 25, CONTENT","131, 153, LOCATION","45, 52, ACTION","56, 64, ACTION","131, 153, LOCATION","154, 176, LOCATION","26, 32, MODAL","180, 225, LOCATION","26, 33, MODAL","83, 131, CONTENT"}
6034	31) The desorption isotherm and the adsorption desorption cycles should be depicted  in graphs instead in the text. The authors should mention and reference that the imprinted polymers can be recycled extensively under carefully selected  conditions (Polym. Chem., 2017, 8, 666-673).	{"251, 281, CONTENT","74, 83, ACTION","88, 94, CONTENT","162, 249, CONTENT","147, 157, ACTION","135, 143, ACTION","128, 135, MODAL","110, 114, LOCATION","75, 85, ACTION","65, 72, MODAL","4, 64, CONTENT","110, 114, LOCATION","65, 71, MODAL"}
6035	32) Either the product form of units (J·mol·K-1) (preferably) or the quotient form (mg/L) should be consistently used  throughout the manuscript.	{"134, 144, LOCATION","65, 89, CONTENT","90, 96, MODAL","134, 144, LOCATION","11, 61, CONTENT","62, 64, TRIGGER","99, 117, ACTION","113, 119, ACTION","90, 97, MODAL"}
6036	The manuscript entitled“Plant based fat, dietary patterns rich in vegetable fat and gut microbiota modulation” (previously entitled“Nuts, plant based fat sources and dietary patterns in microbiota modulation”) presents an interesting issue, but it requires really major corrections before being published.	{"23, 110, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","241, 244, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","241, 244, TRIGGER"}
6037	The main issue is associated with the fact, that Authors presented a highly subjective review of literature. They did not present properly inclusion criteria to qualify the studies to the review. Authors should precise the inclusion criteria and if the review was prepared based on the systematic review method, it must be specified  (as this method is the proper one, while the subjective narrative review is not).	{"211, 219, ACTION","222, 241, CONTENT","323, 334, ACTION","139, 194, CONTENT","118, 138, ACTION","87, 107, CONTENT","69, 86, ACTION","18, 42, TRIGGER","9, 14, ACTION","315, 320, MODAL","304, 310, LOCATION","322, 332, ACTION","204, 210, MODAL","249, 310, CONTENT","246, 248, TRIGGER","204, 211, MODAL"}
6038	The inclusion criteria to qualify the studies to the review must be presented , in the separate Materials and Methods section, because the choice of studies to the review is quite unusual. Authors qualified both review articles and research articles, while a number of the qualified studies are not related to the nuts or fat (e.g. analyzing association between diet and diabetes).	{"96, 125, LOCATION","0, 59, CONTENT","60, 64, MODAL","127, 134, TRIGGER","251, 256, TRIGGER","68, 78, ACTION","60, 64, MODAL","67, 77, ACTION","136, 173, CONTENT","180, 187, ACTION"}
6039	Authors presented basic or even trivial information (e.g.“The macro and micro nutrient composition of different diet results in different substrate available for gut microbial intake”), or the aspects not related to the study directly (e.g. ketogenic diet).	{"57, 183, LOCATION","186, 188, TRIGGER","201, 212, ACTION","193, 200, CONTENT","241, 255, LOCATION","220, 225, LOCATION","32, 51, ACTION","57, 183, LOCATION"}
6040	The manuscript is also shabbily prepared – not according to the instructions for authors (e.g. References section, referring in the text, etc.)	{"23, 40, ACTION","4, 15, LOCATION","47, 88, CONTENT","4, 14, LOCATION","43, 46, TRIGGER","95, 113, LOCATION"}
6042	1. Avoid exaggeration in the manuscript, especially in the title, omit“excellent”.	{"59, 64, LOCATION","3, 9, ACTION","29, 39, LOCATION","9, 21, CONTENT","66, 70, ACTION","29, 39, LOCATION","70, 81, CONTENT"}
6043	2. Instead of flux, report the more meaningful permeability in the manuscript.	{"67, 77, LOCATION","14, 18, CONTENT","3, 10, TRIGGER","67, 77, LOCATION","27, 59, CONTENT","20, 27, ACTION"}
6044	3. The materials section should include the supplier and purity of both GO and TETA. What was the flake size of the GO? Was it mono- or bilayer or?	{"94, 118, CONTENT","25, 39, ACTION","85, 89, TRIGGER","32, 40, ACTION","7, 24, LOCATION","25, 32, MODAL","124, 146, CONTENT","120, 124, TRIGGER","40, 83, CONTENT","85, 93, TRIGGER"}
6045	4. Solvent stability obtained during immersion experiments are not as reliable as continuous filtration through the membrane and therefore it can be misleading  to report long-term stability merely based on immersion into solvents. The loss of polymer during immersion was also not reported. The authors should either carry out these experiments or be more critical with their data and mention these limitations and drawbacks.	{"346, 348, TRIGGER","304, 310, MODAL","145, 159, ACTION","393, 425, CONTENT","318, 327, ACTION","304, 310, MODAL","349, 365, ACTION","377, 381, CONTENT","386, 393, ACTION","328, 345, CONTENT"}
6046	5. The authors should explain how it is possible to increase the flux by 4 times without compromising the rejection. What is the rationale behind such observation?	{"34, 115, CONTENT","30, 34, TRIGGER","122, 162, CONTENT","117, 122, TRIGGER","22, 30, ACTION","15, 22, MODAL","30, 33, TRIGGER","15, 29, ACTION"}
6047	6. Avoid vague expressions such as“strong stirring” and report quantitatively the procedures and results. In this case, what was the rpm of the stirrer and the duration of the agitation? Avoid using the word“obviously” as if something is obvious then it should not be stated  in a scientific article. Rephrase“little changes” in order to form a quantitative statement (line 138).	{"120, 124, TRIGGER","254, 260, MODAL","267, 274, ACTION","34, 51, LOCATION","34, 51, LOCATION","78, 104, CONTENT","120, 124, TRIGGER","207, 218, LOCATION","309, 325, LOCATION","9, 26, CONTENT","3, 9, ACTION","56, 63, ACTION","133, 185, CONTENT","187, 193, ACTION","301, 309, ACTION","369, 377, LOCATION"}
6048	7. It is not possible to reproduce the membrane fabrication as volumes are not given. 1 wt% TETA concentration is insufficient information. The volume of the solution and the membrane area immersed into it for crosslinking should be explicitly mentioned . Instead of wt% use g/L in this case.	{"267, 270, LOCATION","271, 274, ACTION","244, 254, ACTION","140, 222, CONTENT","232, 253, ACTION","223, 229, MODAL","275, 278, CONTENT","256, 263, TRIGGER","223, 230, MODAL"}
6049	8. In the GO section of the introduction the authors should focus on GO-MMMs for organic solvents: http://doi.org/10.1039/C8TA07147K; ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 2018, 10, 16140-16147.	{"53, 59, MODAL","69, 184, CONTENT","60, 66, ACTION","53, 60, MODAL","28, 41, LOCATION","10, 20, LOCATION","28, 40, LOCATION"}
6050	9. A table should be provided  at the end of the results section where the main parameters and performance of the existing GO-MMMs are compared to the one reported by the authors (polymer, GO wt%, crosslinker if any, crosslinking temperature, permeability, solvents tested, rejection versus MW etc.).	{"38, 64, LOCATION","11, 18, MODAL","21, 31, ACTION","71, 299, CONTENT","20, 29, ACTION","11, 17, MODAL","65, 70, TRIGGER","3, 10, CONTENT"}
6051	10. Flux of 118 was reported in the abstract and the conclusions, however, it is clear from the obtained data that this performance is not stable and it is just a first flux before the membrane conditioning / flux decline. Therefore, the stable flux obtained after days of filtration should be reported . Those are the actual flux values one can reliably use the membranes with.	{"20, 29, ACTION","284, 291, MODAL","294, 303, ACTION","4, 15, CONTENT","53, 64, LOCATION","36, 45, LOCATION","66, 73, TRIGGER","284, 290, MODAL","19, 28, ACTION","36, 44, LOCATION","66, 73, TRIGGER","234, 284, CONTENT"}
6052	11. The authors used the same membrane pieces to test in different solvents one after the other (swapping solvents) or always freshly prepared membrane pieces were tested in each solvent? This should be clarified  in the experimental section.	{"119, 186, CONTENT","116, 118, TRIGGER","16, 115, CONTENT","203, 214, ACTION","221, 241, LOCATION","193, 199, MODAL","193, 200, MODAL","202, 212, ACTION"}
6053	12. Avoid using x/y format for the references and use the IUPAC-recommended x y^-1 throughout the manuscript.	{"98, 108, LOCATION","50, 54, ACTION","16, 45, CONTENT","4, 9, ACTION","98, 108, LOCATION","58, 82, CONTENT"}
6054	13. The authors should comment on the reproducibility of the results. Where possible error bars / standard deviations should be given for the breakthrough curves and sorption experiments.	{"16, 22, MODAL","34, 68, CONTENT","85, 117, CONTENT","128, 134, ACTION","138, 186, CONTENT","70, 75, TRIGGER","23, 31, ACTION","16, 23, MODAL","118, 125, MODAL"}
6055	15. The authors should provide a more extensive list of polymers used for nanofiltration in organic solvents, e.g. polybenzimidazole, polyether ether ketone, thermally rearranged polymers (Green Chem., 2016, 18, 2374-2384; J. Membr. Sci., 2018, 550, 322-331).	{"16, 23, MODAL","16, 22, MODAL","31, 258, CONTENT","23, 31, ACTION"}
6056	16. The authors state that developing green methods to reuse organic solvents, i.e. solvent recovery is demanding (line 29). Recent examples and efforts for these with SRNF should be given: Nat. Comm., 2018, 9, 1426; ACS Catal., 2018, 8, 7430-7438; ChemSusChem, 2017, 10, 3435-3444.	{"190, 281, CONTENT","125, 172, CONTENT","173, 180, MODAL","183, 188, ACTION","115, 122, LOCATION","115, 122, LOCATION","173, 179, MODAL"}
6057	17. The authors claim the GO is“uniformly encapsulated” in the polymer matrix. What is the evidence for this? Mapping GO distribution in polymer blends is well-known to be difficult to perform. This statement needs to be backed up with experimental evidence.	{"79, 84, TRIGGER","194, 208, CONTENT","209, 214, MODAL","79, 83, TRIGGER","31, 55, LOCATION","22, 77, CONTENT","87, 108, CONTENT","231, 257, CONTENT","221, 230, ACTION"}
6058	18. The duration of the filtration tests should be reported . Although not reported it seems that the membrane were only tested for a few minutes. How reliable are these measurement? The lack of long-term cross-flow studies should be critically mentioned  in the manuscript.	{"224, 231, MODAL","263, 273, LOCATION","151, 181, CONTENT","147, 151, TRIGGER","183, 223, CONTENT","41, 48, MODAL","51, 60, ACTION","4, 40, CONTENT","41, 47, MODAL","245, 256, ACTION","263, 273, LOCATION","50, 59, ACTION","147, 150, TRIGGER"}
6059	19. The reference list has some typos and inconsistencies in style, the authors should thoroughly proofread it prior to the next submission.	{"8, 22, LOCATION","80, 86, MODAL","27, 66, CONTENT","98, 108, ACTION","80, 87, MODAL"}
6060	20. The conclusions section should summarize the main research findings in a quantitative manner. The impact of the work should be emphasized . Possible leaching of lead from the composite material should be mentioned .	{"121, 128, MODAL","8, 27, LOCATION","208, 218, ACTION","35, 45, ACTION","45, 96, CONTENT","98, 120, CONTENT","189, 197, LOCATION","143, 197, CONTENT","28, 35, MODAL","198, 205, MODAL","28, 34, MODAL","130, 141, ACTION","131, 142, ACTION"}
6061	1) The SEM images cannot be used  for drawing conclusions about the MIP/NIP relative porosity. Based on panel a) and b) the morphology of the two polymers are identical which is expected as the two polymers only differ in the presence of template during their preparation.	{"18, 24, MODAL","18, 24, MODAL","27, 32, ACTION","169, 174, TRIGGER","3, 17, CONTENT","120, 271, CONTENT","34, 93, CONTENT","117, 119, LOCATION","104, 112, LOCATION","28, 32, ACTION"}
6062	2) Magnification of 15k is mentioned in the caption of Figure 2, however 30k is written on the actual SEM image. Please clarify.	{"80, 88, ACTION","55, 63, LOCATION","91, 111, CONTENT","55, 63, LOCATION","65, 72, TRIGGER","73, 76, CONTENT","120, 127, ACTION","3, 23, CONTENT","44, 52, LOCATION","65, 72, TRIGGER","27, 37, ACTION"}
6063	3) The entire manuscript needs to be revised for typos and grammar mistakes. e.g.‘synthesized method’ ->‘synthesis method’; what is meant by‘disturbing the template leakage’?	{"49, 75, CONTENT","124, 128, TRIGGER","140, 173, LOCATION","104, 122, CONTENT","81, 101, LOCATION","14, 24, LOCATION","37, 45, ACTION","124, 128, TRIGGER","14, 25, LOCATION"}
6064	4) Vague expressions and sentences should be avoided . Examples in the abstract:‘The synthesized method was easy, simple, and reproducible.’ -> This sentence is subjective and should be deleted or rephrased  in a quantitative way.‘showed good selectivity’ -> The actual selectivity factor should be mentioned .	{"289, 296, MODAL","3, 34, CONTENT","45, 53, ACTION","35, 42, MODAL","259, 288, CONTENT","230, 255, LOCATION","144, 157, CONTENT","80, 140, LOCATION","208, 229, CONTENT","71, 79, LOCATION","299, 309, ACTION","35, 41, MODAL","44, 52, ACTION","71, 79, LOCATION","197, 208, ACTION","186, 194, ACTION","176, 183, MODAL"}
6065	5) The introduction should cover the MIP literature on environmental/water works (e.g. Analytica Chimica Acta, 610, 2008, 35-43; Green Chemistry, 17, 2015, 5196-5205; Journal of Chromatography A, 1073, 2005, 363-370; Ind.

6066	6) The authors repeatedly mention that the use of dummy templates can avoid the risk of leakage (see abstract, introduction, results and conclusion sections). This sentence needs to be rephrased as the leakage of the employed template cannot be avoided . What they meant is that the target analyte would not contaminate the samples as they do not leach from the polymers (however the dummy-template can still leak from the polymer).	{"185, 195, ACTION","198, 252, CONTENT","39, 95, LOCATION","159, 172, LOCATION","111, 123, LOCATION","255, 259, TRIGGER","260, 270, CONTENT","271, 278, TRIGGER","137, 147, LOCATION","255, 259, TRIGGER","235, 241, MODAL","101, 109, LOCATION","66, 75, ACTION","195, 197, TRIGGER","101, 109, LOCATION","125, 133, LOCATION","173, 178, MODAL","279, 370, CONTENT"}

6068	8) Reusability of imprinted polymers is an important and necessary feature. The authors should comment on the recycle/reusability of their MIPs, and mention their potential over long term as imprinted polymers can be reused over a long time under carefully selected conditions which should be mentioned   (Polym. Chem., 2017, 8, 666-673) under section 2.5.	{"88, 95, MODAL","110, 143, CONTENT","163, 187, CONTENT","344, 355, LOCATION","277, 282, TRIGGER","88, 94, MODAL","191, 276, CONTENT","216, 303, ACTION","293, 302, ACTION","149, 156, ACTION","95, 102, ACTION","306, 336, CONTENT","344, 355, LOCATION","283, 290, MODAL"}
6069	9) The resolution of Figure 4 is low making it impossible to read the legend and subsequently interpret the data presented.	{"21, 29, LOCATION","30, 36, ACTION","3, 17, CONTENT","21, 29, LOCATION"}

6072	12) The conclusion section should be more quantitative, e.g. the LOD and LOQ should be explicitly mentioned .	{"77, 83, MODAL","37, 54, CONTENT","98, 108, ACTION","8, 18, LOCATION","86, 107, ACTION","27, 33, MODAL","8, 26, LOCATION","27, 33, MODAL","61, 76, CONTENT"}
6073	The manuscript entitled“Daily iron supplementation with 60 mg ferrous sulfate for 12-weeks does not increase non-transferrin bound iron concentrations in Cambodian women with a high prevalence of hemoglobinopathies” presents interesting issue, but some really important corrections are needed.	{"23, 215, LOCATION","244, 247, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","244, 247, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION"}
6074	As Authors analysed the iron supplementation in the mixed population of anemic and non-anemic individuals/ individuals with hemoglobinopathies and without, the participants can not be treated  as a homogenic sample. Authors should treat their results as a basis for broader analysis – they should conduct statistical analysis in a sub-groups (for anemic women/ non-anemic women; those with hemoglobinopathies/ without), as without such detailed analysis, the scientific value of the presented results is very low.	{"192, 214, CONTENT","173, 191, ACTION","290, 297, MODAL","297, 305, ACTION","231, 237, ACTION","224, 231, MODAL","183, 191, ACTION","173, 176, MODAL","305, 418, CONTENT","483, 500, LOCATION","501, 512, ACTION","455, 475, CONTENT","431, 453, CONTENT","423, 430, TRIGGER","237, 282, CONTENT","160, 172, LOCATION"}

6076	It seems, that Authors are not native English speakers as some sentences are hard to follow and there is a lack of flow in the text (e.g. lines 18-20 – is 2015 the year or number of women?). The manuscript should be corrected  by native English speaker or preferably by the professional agency.	{"216, 227, ACTION","152, 154, TRIGGER","127, 132, LOCATION","63, 72, CONTENT","77, 91, ACTION","107, 119, ACTION","155, 159, LOCATION","160, 188, CONTENT","206, 213, MODAL","195, 205, LOCATION","138, 149, LOCATION","206, 212, MODAL","215, 225, ACTION","127, 131, LOCATION"}

6078	The title of the study should be specified , as it may be supposed , that Authors analysed sub-sample of Cambodian women with hemoglobinopathies, that was not done – more general and at the same time specific title should be formulated .	{"23, 30, MODAL","215, 222, MODAL","0, 22, CONTENT","33, 43, ACTION","23, 29, MODAL","166, 214, CONTENT","4, 9, LOCATION","32, 42, ACTION","225, 236, ACTION"}
6079	Moreover, the title should not be declarative as it tends to overemphasize conclusions – it should be reformulated  as e.g.“Analysis of influence of iron supplementation on the non-transferrin bound iron concentrations in Cambodian women”	{"14, 19, LOCATION","92, 98, MODAL","102, 114, ACTION","101, 114, ACTION","14, 19, LOCATION","20, 30, MODAL","123, 238, CONTENT","20, 26, MODAL","34, 45, ACTION"}

6085	The section is not consistent – Authors previously present the WHO recommendation and afterwards, they indicate that in their opinion the indicated recommendations have no sense (lines 47-50:“a waste of resources, and at worst, it could cause harm”). Such approach should not be presented . Authors may indicate advantages and disadvantages of recommended policy, but they should not try to discredit WHO. Moreover, Authors should have a broader international perspective and not perceive only the own point of view (Cambodian perspective), as WHO recommendations are for various countries, not only for Cambodia.	{"4, 11, LOCATION","251, 264, CONTENT","179, 190, LOCATION","272, 288, ACTION","303, 311, ACTION","299, 302, MODAL","544, 612, CONTENT","541, 543, TRIGGER","424, 430, MODAL","489, 539, CONTENT","476, 488, ACTION","312, 362, CONTENT","431, 435, ACTION","436, 471, CONTENT","406, 414, TRIGGER","401, 404, CONTENT","380, 400, ACTION","364, 367, TRIGGER","191, 248, LOCATION","373, 379, MODAL","278, 288, ACTION","231, 236, MODAL","86, 96, TRIGGER","265, 271, MODAL","179, 190, LOCATION"}

Authors must in details present recruitment and randomization for their specific analysis (e.g. inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, methodology, procedure of invitation to the study, etc.). In spite of the fact that their analysis was conducted on the basis of a broader study (lines 75-82), the specific information about this specific analysis are necessary.	{"73, 80, ACTION","331, 342, LOCATION","331, 342, LOCATION","36, 47, ACTION","12, 20, MODAL","243, 254, TRIGGER","255, 329, CONTENT","403, 412, ACTION","349, 398, CONTENT","57, 61, MODAL","4, 11, LOCATION","57, 61, MODAL","81, 241, CONTENT"}

6100	The manuscript entitled“Analysis of the effects of dietary pattern on the oral microbiome of elite endurance athletes” presents interesting issue, but some corrections are still needed, as Authors did not correct the previously indicated problems.Major problem:The major problem in the presented study is the fact that participants were assigned to a specific diet base on their own choice “according to their beliefs in the potential effect on their performance”). Authors answered this issue but they did not specify it in their manuscript. Such choice is a very important bias, as the choice is neither random nor based on any criteria. Is should be extensively described  and in my previous review, I have indicated what should be specified  in Materials and Methods section: how were the diets described to participants, was there any special presentation of diets before a choice, which features were presented, who did present diets, was there any possibility to change ones mind, etc. If Authors state that participants choose diet on their own, that must present the detailed procedure influencing  the choice.Abstract:Authors should justify their study – indicate why did they plan to conduct the study exactly in athletes on ketogenic diet (what was the need).Authors should precisely describe the obtained data with the specific results.Materials and Methods:The characteristics of diets should be presented  – the nutritional value and content of products from a specific groups – not for a specific days (as in the previously published studies) but the mean values as they are crucial to interpret the presented data. – Authors stated that it is presented in lines 86-93 but it is not. As I stated previously, Authors should present (1) nutritional value (not only macronutrients), (2) content of products from a specific groupsResults:The characteristics of the studied group should be presented  – especially ethnicity, but also other factors, e.g. gender, BMI, age, previous diet, etc. – it should be presented  as mean (BMI) or share of a group (ethnicity), not as a detailed characteristics of each participant separately and it should be transferred  from supplementary material to the main body of the study.Discussion:Authors should extensively discuss the possible reasons of their observations, while they should relate the discussion to very specific results that were observed and the fact that it was assessed exactly in athletes.Authors should extensively discuss the limitations of the study associated with the conducted study (e.g. method of diet assessment, etc.) and with the concluding (e.g. possibility to conclude on the basis of conducted research, the choice of diet by participants).Authors should formulate the conclusions from their study – real are needed – currently the only conclusion is“to further investigate”. On the basis of conclusions only, it seems that so far Authors had no observations at all.	{"1349, 1370, LOCATION","1371, 1399, CONTENT","1399, 1406, MODAL","1925, 1934, CONTENT","1732, 1738, MODAL","652, 674, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION","643, 649, MODAL","147, 150, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","23, 118, LOCATION","147, 150, TRIGGER","493, 497, TRIGGER","531, 541, LOCATION","319, 389, CONTENT","643, 649, MODAL","665, 674, ACTION","780, 783, TRIGGER","784, 824, CONTENT","887, 892, TRIGGER","893, 916, CONTENT","917, 921, TRIGGER","922, 939, CONTENT","826, 829, TRIGGER","830, 885, ACTION","941, 944, TRIGGER","945, 986, CONTENT","1015, 1052, CONTENT","1059, 1063, MODAL","1064, 1071, ACTION","1072, 1118, CONTENT","1119, 1127, LOCATION","1136, 1142, MODAL","1143, 1150, ACTION","503, 518, ACTION","390, 463, LOCATION","1165, 1173, ACTION","1174, 1270, CONTENT","1279, 1285, MODAL","1296, 1304, ACTION","1305, 1348, CONTENT","2248, 2254, MODAL","2229, 2239, LOCATION","2206, 2215, LOCATION","2176, 2198, LOCATION","2158, 2169, ACTION","2148, 2154, MODAL","2083, 2140, CONTENT","2076, 2079, TRIGGER","2046, 2074, CONTENT","2043, 2045, TRIGGER","2032, 2042, CONTENT","2018, 2027, ACTION","2008, 2014, MODAL","1965, 2002, CONTENT","1901, 1910, ACTION","1891, 1897, MODAL","1850, 1890, CONTENT","1842, 1849, LOCATION","1747, 1842, CONTENT","1739, 1746, ACTION","1410, 1419, ACTION","1423, 1630, CONTENT","1673, 1684, LOCATION","2747, 2779, CONTENT","2737, 2746, ACTION","2730, 2736, MODAL","2492, 2721, CONTENT","2484, 2491, ACTION","2465, 2471, MODAL","2344, 2456, CONTENT","2337, 2343, ACTION","2330, 2336, MODAL","2275, 2317, CONTENT","2267, 2274, ACTION"}
6101	The manuscript by Ma and Liu reviews ZIF membranes for light hydrocarbon separations. The topic is of interest to both professionals and academics working in the fields of membranes, MOFs and hydrocarbon separation. The work fits well the scope of the journal. There are several articles to be incorporated into the review to make it comprehensive. The context is limited and needs to be improved. The materials perspective is good but the engineering angle is limited. The manuscript needs to be reconsidered after having addressed the comments listed below:	{"432, 435, TRIGGER","497, 509, ACTION","474, 484, LOCATION","388, 396, ACTION","376, 381, MODAL","485, 493, MODAL","361, 371, ACTION","349, 360, CONTENT","4, 14, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION"}
6102	1. The review should have more critical comments, and give a fair account of both the advantages and disadvantages of the presented separations. Critical accounts should also be discussed (Current Opinion in Chemical Engineering 2011, 1, 77-83).	{"189, 243, CONTENT","54, 58, ACTION","7, 13, LOCATION","145, 162, CONTENT","21, 25, ACTION","163, 169, MODAL","14, 20, MODAL","26, 48, CONTENT","14, 20, MODAL","82, 143, CONTENT","178, 187, ACTION"}
6103	2. Bulk referencing should be avoided , e.g. [2-5], [14-23] etc. A review article is not the same as a compilation of literature.

In the review the authors should mention the use of software-assisted experimental design of membranes and membrane systems to encourage their use, which does not require extensive theoretical knowledge of the field and can be easily employed  by industrial professionals as well; and give some recent filtration examples from the membrane literature using design of experiments (DoE) optimization approach: ACS Catal., 2018, 8, 7430-7438; J. Membr. Sci., 2015, 493, 568-579.

6113	The main problem is associated with the fact, that Authors applied the tools, that were either not validated at all (their own questionnaire), or were validated, but in a different groups (GSRS validated for groups of IBS patients and pelvic ulcer patients). Without the validation conducted in the properly chosen group, it can not be stated , that the results obtained using the form allow to conclude. This problem is especially important, if the data obtained using the forms are the main data in the study.	{"162, 165, TRIGGER","325, 328, MODAL","335, 342, ACTION","143, 145, TRIGGER","162, 165, TRIGGER"}

6138	The manuscript by Chae and co-workers discusses the isolation and formulation of 1D niobium selenide crystals. The topic is of interest to a broad audience, however the potential impact needs to be emphasized. The manuscript reads well, and the conclusions are supported by experimental evidence. The work lacks of critical evaluation. Overall, it is worth publishing in nanomaterials after addressing the following comments.	{"165, 185, CONTENT","391, 401, ACTION","402, 424, CONTENT","214, 225, LOCATION","198, 208, ACTION","186, 191, MODAL","157, 164, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","157, 164, TRIGGER"}
6139	1.

6140	2. The authors claim that niobium selenide is a“new type of” material. However, it has been studied for a long time with publications from the 70s and 80s.	{"71, 78, TRIGGER","71, 78, TRIGGER","47, 60, LOCATION"}
6141	3. Avoid grouping references, e.g. [1-5], [6-10], [11-23], instead discuss them individually if they are relevant for the manuscript, or if the statement is general then a single book chapter or review article should be cited .	{"3, 8, ACTION","219, 225, ACTION","210, 216, MODAL","170, 209, CONTENT","50, 57, LOCATION","18, 28, CONTENT","35, 40, LOCATION","42, 48, LOCATION","122, 132, LOCATION","210, 216, MODAL","219, 225, ACTION"}
6142	4. Avoid the x/y format for units, and use the x y^-1 format instead, as per the IUPA recommendation (both in the text and on the figures).	{"3, 8, ACTION","39, 42, ACTION","114, 118, LOCATION","130, 137, LOCATION","13, 33, CONTENT","47, 60, CONTENT","114, 118, LOCATION","77, 100, CONTENT"}
6143	5. The authors should comment on the reproducibility of their methods, and preferably provide some quantitative data to demonstrate the robustness of their method.

6145	7. The rationale behind the selection of the solvents should be mentioned . Were they randomly selected? In such an extensive study, the authors could have considered including  some green solvents, especially from the class of alcohols, which seem to work the best based on the results. The authors should refer to book chapter 3.15, Organic Solvents in Sustainable Synthesis and Engineering, Green Chemistry – An Inclusive Approach, 2018, 513-553 (Elsevier) as a guideline for solvent selection.	{"81, 103, CONTENT","76, 80, TRIGGER","64, 73, ACTION","54, 60, MODAL","3, 53, CONTENT","279, 286, LOCATION","300, 306, MODAL","307, 312, ACTION","316, 459, CONTENT","479, 496, CONTENT","63, 73, ACTION","54, 60, MODAL","238, 243, TRIGGER","210, 236, CONTENT","183, 197, CONTENT","167, 176, ACTION","145, 155, MODAL"}

6148	10. The work used 16 conventional solvents and many of them are undesirable for toxicity and environmental reasons. The authors should mention in a sentence that solvent consumption should be minimized  in order to increase the sustainability of the process via sustainable membrane-based recovery (ACS Catal., 2018, 8, 7430–7438; ACS Sustainable Chem.

6179	In this work, the adsorption of a polycation (namely polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride) onto the surface of nanosilica (synthesized from rice husk) was studied. The applicability of surface modified nanosilica in antibiotic (AMX) adsorption was investigated. The topic of the manuscript is suitable for the journal, and the results are interesting. However, there are several issues that must be addressed  prior to further consideration for publishing.	{"8, 12, LOCATION","391, 395, MODAL","371, 385, CONTENT","327, 334, LOCATION","279, 289, LOCATION","279, 289, LOCATION","398, 408, ACTION","391, 395, MODAL","352, 359, TRIGGER","399, 408, ACTION"}
6180	1) The article is full of grammatical mistakes and incorrect use of English which hinders understanding. -> The manuscript should be revised and corrected , preferably by a native speaker or proof-reading company.	{"123, 129, MODAL","26, 75, CONTENT","145, 154, ACTION","133, 140, ACTION","123, 129, MODAL","112, 122, LOCATION","112, 122, LOCATION","132, 154, ACTION","76, 81, TRIGGER"}
6181	2) The introduction is poorly structured, and lacks a logical thread of discussion. -> Problem statement, existing solutions and hypothesis of the work should be clearly stated .	{"52, 82, CONTENT","87, 151, CONTENT","170, 176, ACTION","152, 158, MODAL","7, 19, LOCATION","161, 176, ACTION","152, 158, MODAL","7, 19, LOCATION","23, 40, ACTION","46, 51, ACTION"}
6182	3) The introduction claims environmental remediation as the proposed application area of the prepared adsorbent. However, it is not clear which sector (industrial/domestic waste water treatment, potable water purification, etc.) faces problems caused by antibiotic pollutants where the developed adsorbents could be used . -> The introduction should precisely highlight the reason why new, effective adsorbents for antibiotic removal are needed.	{"113, 120, TRIGGER","128, 137, ACTION","113, 120, TRIGGER","7, 19, LOCATION","7, 19, LOCATION","315, 320, ACTION","307, 312, MODAL","370, 444, CONTENT","360, 369, ACTION","343, 349, MODAL","330, 342, LOCATION","138, 320, CONTENT"}

6209	2, The main text under the ‘results and discussion’ is unnecessarily wordy. Shorten the text and minimize the discussion and reference to literature in this section as the ‘results and discussion’ should focus on the results obtained by the authors. In some cases it is difficult to understand whether the findings are original, or already reported in the literature.	{"27, 51, LOCATION","329, 331, TRIGGER","332, 366, CONTENT","302, 327, CONTENT","55, 74, ACTION","76, 83, ACTION","84, 92, LOCATION","97, 105, ACTION","106, 120, LOCATION","125, 148, ACTION","157, 164, LOCATION","172, 196, LOCATION","197, 203, MODAL","204, 209, ACTION","210, 248, CONTENT","270, 293, ACTION","294, 301, TRIGGER"}

6219	It seems, that Authors are not fluent English speakers as some sentences are hard to follow and some grammar issues must be corrected  (e.g. line 52 it should be“known”).The manuscript should be corrected  by native English speaker or maybe by the professional agency.	{"116, 120, MODAL","124, 133, ACTION","141, 148, LOCATION","101, 115, CONTENT","77, 91, ACTION","141, 148, LOCATION","123, 133, ACTION","116, 120, MODAL","161, 168, CONTENT","174, 184, LOCATION","185, 191, MODAL","195, 204, ACTION"}

Author must be aware that even if he has interesting  idea and valuable results, he can not just present them without a proper justification, discussion, and conclusions.

6280	Author should include adequate references, while self-citations should be avoided , as they are not adequate (3 of 22 references – 14% are the own references by Author)	{"49, 63, CONTENT","22, 41, CONTENT","14, 21, ACTION","7, 13, MODAL","7, 13, MODAL","7, 21, ACTION","115, 128, LOCATION","74, 81, ACTION","64, 70, MODAL"}
6281	The manuscript evaluates the treatment of wastewater in China over the period 2011-2015. It uses a statistical model (Directional Distance Function) to determine the efficiency of inputs and outputs such as GDP, wastewater and expense efficiency. The study is comprehensive; drawing conclusions from data gathered over 31 different regions across China. Based on their findings, the authors give critical recommendations about actions which could be taken. The article fits well into the scope of Applied Sciences and could be further considered  for publication after major alterations.	{"4, 14, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","526, 545, ACTION","441, 446, MODAL","435, 440, TRIGGER"}
6282	1. When stating the input and output variables in Table 1, the authors should explain the parentheses/units and what these refer to (e.g. Population (10,000 persons)). These units on all efficiencies should be made clear before the explanations that follow in Section 4.2.	{"71, 85, ACTION","50, 57, LOCATION","3, 7, TRIGGER","71, 77, MODAL","50, 57, LOCATION","86, 107, CONTENT","71, 77, MODAL","260, 271, LOCATION","210, 220, ACTION","200, 206, MODAL","138, 165, LOCATION","168, 199, CONTENT","117, 131, CONTENT","112, 116, TRIGGER","78, 85, ACTION"}
6283	2. The presentation of data tables should be made neater before publication. As some tables’ present data for 31 regions, these contain lots of information and appear cluttered. The authors could separate regions by gridlines in the tables, making it easier for the reader to visualise.	{"233, 239, LOCATION","23, 34, LOCATION","45, 49, ACTION","57, 75, CONTENT","190, 195, MODAL","196, 204, ACTION","85, 91, LOCATION","35, 41, MODAL","28, 34, LOCATION","35, 41, MODAL","205, 225, CONTENT"}
6284	3. Table 8 should be restructured . It can be seen the heading Rank is sometimes spread over two rows. This appears untidy and should be corrected  prior to publication.	{"51, 101, CONTENT","11, 17, MODAL","3, 10, LOCATION","20, 33, ACTION","11, 17, MODAL","3, 10, LOCATION","21, 33, ACTION","103, 107, CONTENT","127, 133, MODAL","137, 146, ACTION"}
6285	4. For all of the efficiency graphs (Figures 1 – 6), showing average values of various inputs and outputs, each data point should contain standard deviation (or error bars) about these mean values for each year. These would make the figures more information rich and give an idea to the reader regarding  the spread of results about the mean. It should also be stated explicitly how these errors were calculated. As the study is based on a theoretical model, the more statistical analysis that can be presented  in the figures would be beneficial to the manuscript.	{"37, 46, LOCATION","54, 57, TRIGGER","123, 129, MODAL","223, 303, ACTION","554, 564, LOCATION","519, 526, LOCATION","501, 510, ACTION","493, 497, MODAL","459, 488, CONTENT","383, 411, CONTENT","379, 382, TRIGGER","361, 367, ACTION","346, 352, MODAL","130, 137, ACTION","138, 210, CONTENT","37, 50, LOCATION","233, 240, LOCATION","18, 35, LOCATION","107, 122, CONTENT","123, 129, MODAL"}
6286	5. In Section 4.2.2, the author(s) make statements such as: The COD of all regions are all above 0.6534. The author(s) should provide some benchmark values, putting these results into context as to what constitutes a good efficiency score. This could be done by referencing existing literature or modelling  efficiency scores over the previous 10 years in China for comparison. This would help the reader to immediately determine the performance of wastewater treatment compared to similar works.	{"6, 19, LOCATION","198, 202, TRIGGER","251, 258, ACTION","262, 273, ACTION","274, 293, CONTENT","297, 306, ACTION","308, 361, CONTENT","244, 250, MODAL","139, 238, CONTENT","126, 133, ACTION","119, 125, MODAL","60, 103, LOCATION","119, 125, MODAL","250, 306, ACTION","6, 19, LOCATION"}
6287	6. Recent efforts on the wastewater treatment area in China should be acknowledged : Water Res., 2018, 130, 38-46; J. Hazard. Mater., 2018, 354, 81-90.	{"69, 82, ACTION","60, 66, MODAL","70, 82, ACTION","85, 150, CONTENT","3, 59, CONTENT","60, 66, MODAL"}
6288	7. The author(s) are inconsistent in describing the efficiencies. For example in Section 4.2.2 the author(s) state 0.6556 and 7438. The efficiencies should have a maximum value of 1 and these misquotations of results in the text should be corrected  prior to publication.	{"81, 94, LOCATION","239, 248, ACTION","229, 235, MODAL","224, 228, LOCATION","192, 216, CONTENT","161, 181, CONTENT","156, 160, ACTION","149, 155, MODAL","132, 148, CONTENT","126, 130, LOCATION","115, 121, LOCATION","81, 94, LOCATION","149, 155, MODAL","238, 248, ACTION"}
6289	8. In Table 2, it should be made clearer how the Rate (%) is determined (bottom row). It is unclear whether this refers to the duration over which this rate is determined. This should be described  in the table or main body of the text.	{"6, 13, LOCATION","177, 183, MODAL","172, 176, CONTENT","100, 170, CONTENT","89, 99, ACTION","231, 235, LOCATION","214, 223, LOCATION","204, 210, LOCATION","41, 44, TRIGGER","18, 24, MODAL","186, 196, ACTION","6, 13, LOCATION","18, 24, MODAL","28, 40, ACTION","41, 44, TRIGGER","187, 196, ACTION","45, 84, CONTENT"}
6290	9. Given the global trend toward sustainable solutions, the authors should write a short paragraph in the introduction, and mention the importance and need for sustainable solutions for various applications among them water treatment, and give some diverse examples such desalination (Green Chem., 2018, 20, 3689-3695); wastewater treatment (Green Chem., 2015, 17, 5196-5205); water management (J. Clean. Product., 2018, 172, 786-794); catalysis (ACS Catal., 2018, 8, 7430-7438); extraction (J. Clean.

6291	10. The author(s) frequently refer to the‘5-Year Plan’ throughout the text. It should be stated what this refers to in the introduction, outlining the goals and origin of the plan. For readers outside of China, this is not immediately clear upon reading the article.	{"89, 95, ACTION","123, 135, LOCATION","147, 179, CONTENT","137, 146, ACTION","41, 54, LOCATION","88, 95, ACTION","79, 85, MODAL","96, 100, TRIGGER","79, 85, MODAL","70, 74, LOCATION","41, 54, LOCATION"}
6292	The manuscript entitled „ Consumption of ultra-processed foods and nutritional profile in a health promotion service of Brazilian primary care” presents interesting issue, but some areas must be corrected . Unfortunately Authors still did not correct the problems which I indicated in my previous review.	{"176, 186, CONTENT","251, 263, CONTENT","235, 250, ACTION","195, 204, ACTION","187, 191, MODAL","172, 175, TRIGGER","24, 143, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","194, 204, ACTION","187, 191, MODAL","172, 175, TRIGGER"}

6295	Authors improperly conducted their statistical analysis – they should use appropriate statistical test based on the distribution and analyse exact data which are presented in tables.	{"63, 69, MODAL","74, 128, CONTENT","133, 140, ACTION","141, 157, CONTENT","175, 181, LOCATION","152, 157, TRIGGER","63, 73, ACTION","175, 181, LOCATION","70, 73, ACTION"}
6296	Authors did not take into account the normality of distribution – it should be verified and defined and afterwards data presentation and statistical tests should be based  on the distribution.	{"115, 154, CONTENT","34, 63, CONTENT","165, 170, ACTION","78, 170, ACTION","69, 75, MODAL","8, 33, ACTION","104, 114, TRIGGER","69, 75, MODAL","79, 87, ACTION","92, 99, ACTION","155, 161, MODAL"}

6299	The manuscript details the fabrication, characterisation and some performance tests of dopamine-based FO membranes. The work has some novelty and potential impact. The topic is of interest to a broad audience. However, whether the manuscript fits within the scope of the journal is questionable. The manuscript is well-written and organized. The following technical issues need to be addressed:	{"210, 217, TRIGGER","373, 377, MODAL","342, 372, CONTENT","210, 217, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","384, 393, ACTION"}
6300	1. Only 0.3 wt% DA was present in the membrane? The authors should also quantify the amount of the DA used during  the membrane preparation and express its incorporation into the membrane. It seems that most of the DA remains in solution and does not for part of the membrane. In this case the problem of lack of sustainability should be mentioned  in the manuscript.	{"60, 66, MODAL","60, 66, MODAL","72, 80, ACTION","338, 347, ACTION","81, 139, CONTENT","144, 151, ACTION","356, 366, LOCATION","152, 187, CONTENT","3, 46, CONTENT","356, 366, LOCATION","328, 334, MODAL","290, 327, CONTENT","66, 113, ACTION"}
6301	2. The experimental description for the TFC membrane (section 2.3) is not clearly explained. A table should be included  with all the components and relevant information for each membrane. The wt% does not add up to 100.	{"93, 100, CONTENT","54, 65, LOCATION","3, 52, CONTENT","213, 219, CONTENT","197, 212, ACTION","193, 196, LOCATION","126, 187, CONTENT","111, 119, ACTION","101, 107, MODAL","54, 65, LOCATION","110, 119, ACTION","101, 107, MODAL","70, 91, ACTION"}
6302	3. The abstract and the conclusion sections read the same.

6307	8. The error bars are standard deviations? Based on how many measurements? Were independently prepared membranes used? These should be clarified  in the manuscript.	{"52, 55, TRIGGER","125, 131, MODAL","3, 41, CONTENT","43, 73, CONTENT","75, 79, TRIGGER","80, 117, CONTENT","119, 124, CONTENT","125, 131, MODAL","135, 144, ACTION","153, 163, LOCATION","134, 144, ACTION","153, 163, LOCATION"}
6308	The manuscript by Terraza et al. describes the effect of nanoparticles on PVDF-based mixed matrix membranes. The manuscript is well written, it has a good amount of data presented, and it is of interest to a broad audience working as materials scientists, polymer chemists or chemical engineers. The discussions and the data are of good quality. The work is novel and has a potential to be published in polymers subject to addressing the following concerns:	{"4, 14, LOCATION","434, 456, CONTENT","4, 14, LOCATION","113, 123, LOCATION","300, 311, LOCATION","320, 324, LOCATION","423, 433, ACTION"}
6309	1. The panels in Figure 1 need to be labelled“a” to“d” and the figure caption needs to describe each panel for better understanding of the procedure.	{"96, 106, LOCATION","37, 45, ACTION","78, 83, MODAL","63, 77, LOCATION","7, 25, LOCATION","26, 30, MODAL","45, 54, CONTENT","17, 25, LOCATION","87, 95, ACTION"}
6310	2. The MMM preparation is somewhat unclear. The 2-10 wt.% refers to the solid content of the final membrane, or the entire dope solution comprising of the polymer, NP and solvent? The composition should be clarified  in the text (line 134).	{"196, 202, MODAL","224, 228, LOCATION","206, 215, ACTION","196, 202, MODAL","109, 111, TRIGGER","3, 22, CONTENT","48, 57, LOCATION","35, 42, ACTION","224, 228, LOCATION","180, 195, CONTENT","205, 215, ACTION","112, 178, CONTENT","230, 238, LOCATION","58, 107, CONTENT"}
6311	3. A more elaborate explanation should be provided on the observation that the NPs are preferably located  in the bulk and not the surface (paragraph 231). Is there a sufficient adhesion of the NPs to the polymer matrix? Are the NPs breaking off the surface? These problems often seen for MMMs when rigid fillers are used. A crosslinking solution has been proposed to achieve robust MMMs, which should be mentioned  by the authors (ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 2018, 10, 16140-16147).	{"156, 158, TRIGGER","3, 31, CONTENT","32, 38, MODAL","42, 50, ACTION","75, 138, CONTENT","140, 153, LOCATION","165, 219, CONTENT","221, 224, TRIGGER","225, 257, CONTENT","323, 387, CONTENT","395, 401, MODAL","405, 414, ACTION","432, 482, CONTENT","140, 149, LOCATION","41, 105, ACTION","32, 38, MODAL","294, 298, TRIGGER"}
6312	4. The molecular weight of the PVDF purchased should be mentioned  under section 2.

6318	10. A similar membrane distillation approach of MMM using PVDF but not with Cu-NPs but GO was reported in the literature, which also focus on the effect of the filler, and therefore should be acknowledged  in the introduction around line 93 (J.

6320	13. The conclusion section is weak and does not provide a sufficient discussion on the main conclusions. Elaborate more and add some quantitative statements regarding the main research outcomes. The limitations and drawbacks of the approach as well as future directions (e.g. test the membranes in membrane distillation?) should be briefly mentioned .	{"56, 103, CONTENT","115, 119, CONTENT","105, 114, ACTION","39, 55, ACTION","322, 328, MODAL","331, 349, ACTION","8, 18, LOCATION","128, 193, CONTENT","340, 349, ACTION","27, 34, ACTION","8, 26, LOCATION","124, 127, ACTION","322, 328, MODAL","195, 321, CONTENT"}
6321	The manuscript entitled“The Role of Foods as Dietary Sources of Vitamin D for Ethnic Minority Populations: The Underestimated Challenge” presents interesting issue, but some really major  corrections are needed.	{"4, 14, LOCATION","169, 199, CONTENT","204, 210, ACTION","165, 168, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","23, 136, LOCATION","165, 168, TRIGGER"}
6322	(1)    Major problem associated with applied definitions and improperly formulated title/ aim of the study:	{"83, 88, LOCATION","83, 88, LOCATION","90, 106, LOCATION"}
6323	Authors improperly formulated the title and the aim, while compared with the main body of the study, as there seem to be a misunderstanding of some definitions. Authors use the terms such as“ethnic populations”/“ethnic minority”, while they state that there is a problem“due to the skin pigment melanin and/or reduced skin exposure due to coverage required by religious and cultural restrictions”. But the definition of“ethnic populations”/“ethnic minority” is different and incomparable with those applied by Authors. The“ethnic group” is defined as a group of people with the common nation, ancestry, history, language, culture, society, while“ethnic minority” is defined as a group of people with common nation, ancestry, etc., that is different from the majority of population.	{"440, 457, LOCATION","34, 39, LOCATION","48, 51, LOCATION","77, 86, LOCATION","190, 210, LOCATION","211, 228, LOCATION","270, 396, LOCATION","398, 401, TRIGGER","419, 439, LOCATION","522, 536, LOCATION","645, 662, LOCATION","398, 401, TRIGGER","34, 39, LOCATION","8, 29, ACTION"}
6324	So, Authors must understand, that“skin pigment melanin and/or reduced skin exposure due to coverage required by religious and cultural restrictions” is typical for only SOME of minorities – e.g. Malaysian minority in Great Britain. But for the British minority in Malaysia, there is totally different problem (e.g. resulting from lack of traditional British products being sources of vitamin D).	{"12, 16, MODAL","232, 235, TRIGGER","17, 27, ACTION","232, 235, TRIGGER","33, 148, LOCATION","12, 16, MODAL","33, 148, LOCATION"}
6325	It seems, that Authors aimed to assess the minorities in western countries, but is also not so simple, as for French minority in Great Britain the indicated problems also do not exist. So maybe Authors wanted to assess just Middle East, Asian and African minorities? If so, there is not adequate information in the study.	{"315, 320, LOCATION","209, 265, CONTENT","76, 79, TRIGGER","280, 286, ACTION","287, 307, CONTENT"}
6326	Authors must verify their approach and reformulate their thesis in order to be in agreement with the general definitions. Lack of a broader international perspective and perceiving only the own point of view seem as a lack of political correctness. It should be re-analyzed not only due to communicativeness of the study, but also due to presenting improper beliefs and opinions (western people are ALSO minorities if changing the country).	{"252, 258, MODAL","262, 273, ACTION","13, 19, ACTION","249, 251, CONTENT","20, 34, CONTENT","39, 50, ACTION","51, 63, CONTENT","8, 19, ACTION","252, 258, MODAL","322, 325, TRIGGER","8, 12, MODAL"}
6327	The serious flaw of the presented manuscript is associated with the fact, that it presents a highly subjective review, not a systematic review.

6328	Taking into account, that the Materials and methods section is not presented, without any specific information, it is hard to understand which studies were included into review and why.

6377	In this article, the authors investigated the reaction of hydrogen sulphide on Pd membranes, and its influence on hydrogen permeability. A redox methodology was also proposed for the removal of hydrogen sulphide to restore Pd activity. While results showed that the sulphides could be completely removed , due to the lack of real-case experiments (i.e., the change in hydrogen selectivity was not studied), and some false assumptions the manuscript needs to be seriously revised prior to further consideration. Consequently, I recommend major revision.

6461	The manuscript by Liu and co-workers is of interest to a broader scientific and professional community but the manuscript need to be significantly improved prior to acceptance for publication. The work is detailed enough to ensure understanding, the majority of the manuscript reads well and built in a logical manner. However, some technical and presentation issues need to be addressed, and the introduction is too narrow and a broader context needs to be given.	{"446, 451, MODAL","147, 155, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION","328, 367, CONTENT","367, 371, MODAL","378, 387, ACTION","122, 127, MODAL","102, 106, TRIGGER","458, 463, ACTION","103, 106, TRIGGER","266, 276, LOCATION","397, 409, LOCATION","410, 423, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION","319, 326, TRIGGER","111, 121, LOCATION","428, 445, CONTENT"}

6469	8. Before the final paragraph in the Introduction, the authors should add a short, second-to-last paragraph on sustainability from a general perspective. Mention that attempts toward sustainable production is emerging in various fields such as agriculture (Green Chem., 2017, 19, 3116-3125.), microbiology (Microb. Biotechnol., 2017, 10, 1066-1069.), pharmaceuticals (ChemSusChem, 2017, 10, 3435-3444.), biotechnology (Microb.

6473	12. The Conclusions section needs to be more critical and include more detailed research needs and directions based on the findings presented in the manuscript. Moreover, the main research findings should be quantitatively summarized  in this section.	{"172, 197, CONTENT","149, 159, LOCATION","207, 233, ACTION","198, 204, MODAL","161, 169, TRIGGER","27, 33, MODAL","57, 65, ACTION","161, 170, TRIGGER","197, 204, MODAL","8, 27, LOCATION","37, 53, ACTION","66, 131, CONTENT","223, 233, ACTION","238, 250, LOCATION","149, 159, LOCATION"}
6474	The manuscript entitled “Dietary supplements among professional athletes: food neophobia and marketing strategies to promote edible insects” presents interesting and original issue, being within the scope of the journal. The presented results may be of a significant importance for both researchers and practitioners, but a number of important corrections are necessary.	{"318, 321, TRIGGER","24, 140, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","322, 355, CONTENT","243, 246, MODAL","356, 370, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION","318, 321, TRIGGER"}
6476	In general, in the case of studies involving human subjects (also for the retrospective analysis), the agreement of the ethical committee is compulsory – as it is defined: ‘No one should participate in research unless independent review concludes that the risks are reasonable in relation to the potential benefits.’ (National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) - https://bioethicsarchive.georgetown.edu/nbac/human/oversumm.html).	{"15, 137, CONTENT","138, 151, ACTION","180, 186, MODAL","173, 432, CONTENT"}
6477	Moreover, it is recommended, that the study should not be published  if it involves human subjects, but there is no relevant agreement of the ethical committee.	{"58, 68, ACTION","44, 50, MODAL","100, 103, TRIGGER","0, 8, TRIGGER","57, 67, ACTION","34, 43, CONTENT","100, 103, TRIGGER","69, 98, CONTENT","44, 54, MODAL"}
6478	So in such case, Authors should precisely indicate the agreement – they can obtain it in any local ethical committee in Italy, or obtain an official exemption from ethical committee (official statement from their local ethical committee with its reference number, that their study may be conducted / published with no ethical committee agreement).	{"42, 50, ACTION","25, 32, MODAL","136, 347, CONTENT","50, 64, CONTENT","72, 75, MODAL","76, 82, ACTION","83, 125, CONTENT","129, 136, ACTION","25, 31, MODAL","287, 297, ACTION","192, 201, LOCATION"}
6479	Authors should specify the aim of their study (e.g. “The aim of the study was…”) instead of presenting only what was done.	{"7, 14, MODAL","15, 23, ACTION","108, 112, TRIGGER","8, 22, ACTION","92, 121, CONTENT","23, 80, CONTENT","81, 91, TRIGGER"}
6480	The Abstract section should present specific data associated with the studied group – “athletes” – what discipline? What gender? What age? how were they recruited?, etc.	{"121, 127, CONTENT","134, 137, CONTENT","104, 114, CONTENT","129, 134, TRIGGER","116, 120, TRIGGER","98, 103, TRIGGER","139, 142, TRIGGER","143, 162, CONTENT","86, 96, LOCATION","36, 83, CONTENT","4, 20, LOCATION","21, 35, ACTION","21, 27, MODAL","28, 35, ACTION","99, 103, TRIGGER","4, 12, LOCATION"}

6483	This section is very, very, very long. Instead of 3.5 pages of various information, Authors should focus on the most important (0.5-1 page is enough for this section). But they should properly justify the study, while presenting briefly what is known and what data are necessary for broadening our general knowledge. The suggested issue that should be mentioned here is adult food neophobia, and its consequences, especially in athletes.	{"342, 348, MODAL","92, 98, MODAL","177, 184, MODAL","192, 200, ACTION","352, 361, ACTION","0, 12, LOCATION","168, 171, TRIGGER","50, 59, LOCATION","39, 49, TRIGGER","351, 361, ACTION","92, 98, MODAL","370, 436, CONTENT","317, 336, CONTENT","218, 315, CONTENT","200, 210, CONTENT","168, 171, TRIGGER","153, 165, LOCATION","128, 138, CONTENT","108, 126, CONTENT","99, 104, ACTION","13, 37, ACTION"}
6484	In this section Authors should avoid excessive references (e.g. line 219), as this section in not the literature presentation, but rather it requires brief presentation of applied methodology.	{"78, 90, LOCATION","64, 72, LOCATION","3, 15, LOCATION","127, 131, TRIGGER","30, 37, ACTION","127, 130, TRIGGER","24, 36, ACTION","37, 57, CONTENT","23, 30, MODAL","64, 72, LOCATION"}

6486	In this section Authors should present the information that participants were presented with the photo of assessed bar (as stated “brief informative text on the environmental and nutritional benefits of the feeding based on insects, as well as the role that athletes can have in promoting  healthy foods”), as they may have influenced the obtained results. This information may be presented  as a supplementary file, but it should be in details presented  (specific sentences translated into English)	{"3, 15, LOCATION","424, 430, MODAL","417, 420, TRIGGER","397, 415, LOCATION","444, 454, ACTION","315, 318, MODAL","149, 153, LOCATION","373, 377, MODAL","356, 373, CONTENT","38, 306, CONTENT","31, 38, ACTION","381, 390, ACTION","24, 30, MODAL","417, 420, TRIGGER","24, 38, ACTION"}

6489	As indicated above, Authors should rather focus on novelty of their study. Analyzing only results obtained for an insect bar as dependent from FNS results may be interesting enough to be published , but only if properly analyzed.	{"161, 196, ACTION","41, 47, ACTION","199, 202, TRIGGER","28, 34, MODAL","48, 74, CONTENT","27, 34, MODAL"}

6494	Authors who did not participate in the manuscript preparing but had other role (BDD, LM) should be removed  from the Study Authors, due to the risk of guest authorship procedure that is forbidden and they should be rather presented  in Acknowledgements Section. Only Authors who actively participated in manuscript preparation should be presented  as authors of the study, while Authors may thank other persons who contributed in Acknowledgements Section.	{"326, 333, MODAL","39, 49, LOCATION","98, 106, ACTION","261, 300, CONTENT","60, 63, TRIGGER","204, 212, MODAL","430, 454, LOCATION","99, 106, ACTION","0, 89, CONTENT","89, 95, MODAL","89, 96, MODAL","183, 195, ACTION","151, 167, CONTENT","236, 260, LOCATION","336, 346, ACTION","214, 221, TRIGGER","222, 231, ACTION"}
6495	The manuscript by Zhu and Li investigates a coagulation process for water treatment. The topic is of interest to both professionals and academics working in the fields of filtration, water treatment and optimization. The work fits well the scope of the journal, however the novelty needs to be clarified, the context needs to be broadened and some technical aspects need to be improved. There are several issues that must be addressed  prior to further consideration by Processes. The manuscript needs to be reconsidered after having carefully addressed the comments listed below:	{"305, 316, CONTENT","4, 14, LOCATION","342, 365, CONTENT","270, 281, CONTENT","417, 421, MODAL","424, 434, ACTION","387, 411, CONTENT","262, 270, TRIGGER","424, 434, ACTION","366, 371, MODAL","329, 338, ACTION","417, 421, MODAL","281, 287, MODAL","262, 269, TRIGGER","317, 322, MODAL","376, 385, ACTION","294, 303, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION"}
6496	1. What is the novelty of the work in relation to the state-of-the-art literature and industrial practices? It is unclear what this manuscript contributes to the literature that is not yet reported.

6507	12. The authors should mention the use of software-assisted experimental design of purification systems to encourage their use, which does not require extensive theoretical knowledge of the field and can be easily employed  by industrial professionals as well; and give some recent filtration examples from the literature using DoE optimization approach: ACS Catal., 2018, 8, 7430-7438; J.

6511	16. The results section has an extensive amount of references. After each result a reference is given. This is confusing and implies that all the observations were already made in the literature, which leads to the conclusion that the manuscript lacks novelty. The authors should explicitly mention what new observation were made by the authors and supported by new data presented in the submitted manuscript.	{"398, 408, LOCATION","291, 298, ACTION","298, 370, CONTENT","8, 23, LOCATION","273, 279, MODAL","215, 225, LOCATION","273, 279, MODAL","196, 201, TRIGGER"}

However, there are several technical and other issues to be addressed before further consideration to be published in the journal.	{"212, 221, TRIGGER","221, 267, CONTENT","4, 14, LOCATION","213, 220, TRIGGER","273, 282, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION"}
6517	1. How does the perlite composition and morphology affect the sorption results and the final composite material? The authors should comment on the robustness and general applicability of their results.	{"7, 111, CONTENT","3, 6, TRIGGER","140, 203, CONTENT","103, 111, LOCATION","3, 6, TRIGGER","131, 139, ACTION","125, 131, MODAL","125, 131, MODAL"}
6518	2. The properties of the perlite are given in lines 68-72, however the sentence introduces these with a“may be” which is unusual. Were the reported values measured or taken from the literature? The authors should characterize their own adsorbent. Nonetheless, the results should be reported  in the results section and not the experimental section.	{"138, 147, ACTION","46, 57, LOCATION","213, 225, ACTION","272, 278, MODAL","258, 271, CONTENT","58, 66, TRIGGER","282, 290, ACTION","206, 213, MODAL","225, 245, CONTENT","59, 66, TRIGGER","206, 212, MODAL","327, 347, LOCATION","130, 134, TRIGGER","46, 57, LOCATION","135, 192, CONTENT","299, 314, LOCATION","319, 322, TRIGGER"}
6519	3. The introduction of the different chemicals and materials used in the study are scattered in the manuscript. These should be all gathered  at the beginning of the experimental section. All the purity / grade and supplier should be mentioned  at this stage.	{"79, 92, ACTION","7, 19, LOCATION","188, 224, CONTENT","224, 231, MODAL","234, 243, ACTION","125, 127, ACTION","118, 124, MODAL","127, 140, ACTION","2, 78, CONTENT","92, 110, LOCATION","118, 124, MODAL","141, 188, LOCATION"}
6520	4. What is the reported typical concentration for lead in industrial wastewater that the authors proposed to treat? How does the concentration of the ion sorption experiments compare to the industrial practice? In other words, did the authors test relevant concentrations?	{"3, 7, TRIGGER","115, 120, TRIGGER","227, 271, CONTENT","2, 7, TRIGGER","8, 114, CONTENT","120, 209, CONTENT"}
6521	5. Avoid using x/y format for the references and use the IUPAC-recommended x y^-1 throughout the manuscript.	{"9, 44, CONTENT","97, 107, LOCATION","53, 81, CONTENT","49, 52, ACTION","97, 107, LOCATION","2, 9, ACTION"}
6522	6. Avoid vague and informal expressions such as“huge” and“remarkable”.	{"3, 8, ACTION","47, 53, LOCATION","9, 69, CONTENT"}
6523	7. The authors should comment on the reproducibility of the results. Where possible error bars / standard deviations should be given for the breakthrough curves and sorption experiments.	{"22, 30, ACTION","15, 21, MODAL","15, 21, MODAL","69, 74, TRIGGER","126, 132, ACTION","133, 186, CONTENT","116, 124, MODAL","75, 116, CONTENT","30, 68, CONTENT"}
6524	8. Half of the introduction describes what the authors did instead of providing a context and background to the research area. Elaborate on wastewater treatment and current challenges. Mention the use of perlite for wastewater treatment: J. Environ. Chem. Eng., 2018, 6, 451-458.	{"38, 42, TRIGGER","140, 183, CONTENT","127, 137, ACTION","184, 192, ACTION","15, 27, LOCATION","193, 278, CONTENT","15, 27, LOCATION"}
6525	9. The use of perlite for wastewater treatment can be considered  a sustainable solution, which should be stressed  by the authors, and the importance of / trend toward sustainable water treatment should be exemplified  in the introduction: Green Chem., 2015, 17, 5196-5205; RSC Adv., 2016, 6, 45041-45048).	{"227, 239, LOCATION","241, 306, CONTENT","53, 64, ACTION","47, 50, MODAL","90, 95, TRIGGER","106, 114, ACTION","3, 47, CONTENT","136, 196, CONTENT","207, 218, ACTION","196, 204, MODAL","227, 239, LOCATION","96, 102, MODAL"}
6526	10. The reference list has some typos and inconsistencies in style, the authors should thoroughly proofread it prior to the next submission.	{"80, 86, MODAL","80, 86, MODAL","3, 67, CONTENT","98, 107, ACTION"}
6527	11. The conclusions section should summarize the main research findings in a quantitative manner. The impact of the work should be emphasized . Possible leaching of lead from the composite material should be mentioned .	{"45, 96, CONTENT","131, 141, ACTION","207, 217, ACTION","98, 120, CONTENT","197, 204, MODAL","143, 197, CONTENT","120, 127, MODAL","34, 44, ACTION","28, 34, MODAL","189, 197, LOCATION","130, 141, ACTION","28, 34, MODAL","8, 27, LOCATION"}
6528	The manuscript entitled“The Fast Cooking and Enhanced Iron Bioavailability Properties of the Manteca Yellow Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)” presents interesting issue but some major corrections are needed.	{"169, 191, CONTENT","23, 137, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","196, 202, ACTION","164, 169, TRIGGER","165, 168, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION"}
6529	Careful editing is needed (e.g. doubled spaces after each sentence)	{"26, 67, CONTENT","19, 25, ACTION","58, 66, LOCATION","0, 15, CONTENT"}
6530	Instead of ”food” (e.g. line 12, 33), Authors should use the phrase“food product”	{"46, 56, ACTION","24, 31, LOCATION","45, 52, MODAL","53, 56, ACTION","56, 83, CONTENT","24, 35, LOCATION","0, 10, TRIGGER","11, 17, LOCATION"}
6531	Authors tend to indicate multiple references for each presented information and as a result, they included an excessive number of references (77 for the whole study, while for the Introduction only – there is 34 of them!) – the number of references should be reduced , while Authors should try to reduce the number of their own references, as they included references for 11 own studies – such excessive self-referring should be reduced .	{"389, 418, CONTENT","429, 436, ACTION","304, 386, CONTENT","283, 289, MODAL","297, 303, ACTION","259, 266, ACTION","249, 255, MODAL","224, 248, CONTENT","180, 192, LOCATION","258, 266, ACTION","248, 255, MODAL","269, 275, TRIGGER","418, 425, MODAL"}
6532	Line 14 –“hundreds of millions” seems to be some exaggeration, as not all inhabitants consume exactly Phaseolus vulgaris L.	{"0, 7, LOCATION","0, 7, LOCATION","41, 61, ACTION","66, 122, CONTENT","9, 31, LOCATION"}

6534	Authors should precisely indicate the aim of the study – not the aim of YBP (lines 17-19), or indicate, that they presented all the results of YBP	{"75, 89, LOCATION","77, 88, LOCATION","8, 14, MODAL","24, 33, ACTION","7, 14, MODAL","91, 93, TRIGGER","104, 146, CONTENT","34, 75, CONTENT","94, 102, ACTION"}

6536	Authors should present only the most important information to justify their study – number of information presented should be reduced  and Authors should especially reduce the number of information that are irrelevant for the iron bioavailability and beans intake.	{"83, 116, CONTENT","172, 264, CONTENT","23, 81, CONTENT","15, 23, ACTION","8, 15, MODAL","126, 133, ACTION","8, 14, MODAL","165, 171, ACTION","8, 22, ACTION","116, 123, MODAL","147, 154, MODAL"}
6537	While justifying the study, Authors must emphasize arguments being  important for the nutritional value of beans (factors reducing bioavailability), as well as nutrients intake in the indicated countries (iron deficiencies). While Authors concentrate on the arguments associated with fuel sources for cooking, or deforestation, it seems that such Introduction is not adequate for the study, or even it seems that the study is not adequate for Nutrients journal and should be rather submitted to the journal associated  with the sustainable production and consumption (e.g. Sustainability).	{"347, 359, LOCATION","40, 66, ACTION","465, 471, MODAL","36, 40, MODAL","40, 50, ACTION","51, 223, CONTENT","465, 472, MODAL","492, 589, CONTENT","481, 492, ACTION","347, 359, LOCATION"}
6538	Lines 83-92 – Authors should briefly present the aim of the study (preferably one sentence) with no unnecessary methodology information, that should be presented  in Materials and Methods section	{"45, 135, CONTENT","166, 195, LOCATION","37, 44, ACTION","0, 12, LOCATION","22, 29, MODAL","142, 149, MODAL","0, 11, LOCATION","151, 161, ACTION","22, 28, MODAL","151, 161, ACTION"}
6539	Lines 95-145 – the excessive information about YBP should be reduced . Authors should for the beginning  indicate why they refer the YBP (does the study present some chosen result of YBP or all the results; was YBP designed to verify the hypothesis of the presented study or was it a broaden initiative, etc.)	{"60, 68, ACTION","0, 14, LOCATION","15, 50, CONTENT","79, 85, MODAL","61, 68, ACTION","0, 12, LOCATION","50, 57, MODAL","51, 57, MODAL","114, 309, CONTENT","105, 114, ACTION"}

6544	Defining the serving size on the basis of the USDA data is highly controversial. As Authors stated, that Phaseolus vulgaris L. is a typical product for Latin America, Caribbean and Africa, they must precisely define serving size on the basis of eating  behaviours typical for indicated areas, not on the basis of eating behaviours typical for USA. The USDA data may be indicated  as supplementary ones.	{"383, 396, LOCATION","194, 198, MODAL","362, 365, MODAL","198, 251, ACTION","380, 401, CONTENT","293, 296, TRIGGER","216, 291, CONTENT","348, 361, CONTENT","369, 379, ACTION","209, 215, ACTION","362, 365, MODAL"}

6546	Authors presented in their tables only mean value, with no information about SD. Moreover, it was not indicated on the basis of how many measurements was it obtained. It is only specified, that two field replicates were applied, but the number of analysed samples and repetitions must be specified  (n=?).	{"177, 187, ACTION","81, 89, TRIGGER","280, 284, MODAL","27, 33, LOCATION","94, 111, ACTION","300, 303, CONTENT","288, 297, ACTION","280, 284, MODAL","233, 279, CONTENT","229, 232, TRIGGER","128, 165, CONTENT","27, 33, LOCATION"}
6547	If the distribution is normal, the mean values should be presented  (accompanied by SD), but if it is different than normal, the median, accompanied by minimum and maximum values should be presented  – it should be specified  that distribution is normal if it is.	{"69, 86, CONTENT","57, 66, ACTION","0, 2, TRIGGER","89, 92, TRIGGER","231, 262, CONTENT","13, 16, TRIGGER","179, 185, MODAL","56, 66, ACTION","30, 47, CONTENT","124, 179, CONTENT","189, 199, ACTION","215, 224, ACTION","47, 54, MODAL","47, 53, MODAL","205, 211, MODAL"}

6549	Authors should combine the tables presented in this section, as a number of small tables is presented for the same genotypes and each information is now in the separate table. Author may design horizontal tables instead of vertical ones and combine a number of small tables into larger one. Afterwards, they may transfer the most important information from the supplementary material to the main body of the manuscript, as they should not refer the supplementary tables in the Results section – if they want to refer precisely to the data presented in the tables they should present them in the main body of the study.	{"595, 617, LOCATION","477, 492, LOCATION","494, 497, TRIGGER","530, 562, CONTENT","47, 59, LOCATION","194, 211, CONTENT","211, 222, TRIGGER","223, 236, CONTENT","241, 248, ACTION","249, 289, CONTENT","357, 383, LOCATION","391, 418, LOCATION","428, 438, MODAL","439, 444, ACTION","449, 469, LOCATION","15, 23, ACTION","23, 34, CONTENT","183, 187, MODAL","187, 193, ACTION","308, 311, MODAL","311, 320, ACTION","320, 351, CONTENT","568, 582, ACTION","8, 14, MODAL","567, 575, MODAL","575, 583, ACTION","27, 33, LOCATION","291, 301, TRIGGER","8, 15, MODAL"}

6551	Authors should correct the section accordingly – if distribution of data is different than normal, Authors should apply non-parametric tests and afterwards correct the observed results and discussion.	{"27, 34, LOCATION","49, 52, TRIGGER","8, 14, MODAL","189, 199, LOCATION","8, 22, ACTION","8, 14, MODAL","145, 155, TRIGGER","164, 202, CONTENT","155, 164, ACTION","120, 140, CONTENT","114, 120, ACTION","107, 113, MODAL","52, 97, CONTENT","14, 23, ACTION"}
6552	Authors should not present the specific data and refer the supplementary material in this section (e.g. line 387), but focus on the discussion of results with no reproducing them unnecessarily.	{"59, 72, LOCATION","26, 44, CONTENT","49, 55, ACTION","113, 118, TRIGGER","118, 124, ACTION","125, 193, CONTENT","115, 118, TRIGGER","8, 14, MODAL","85, 97, LOCATION","8, 18, MODAL","19, 26, ACTION","59, 81, LOCATION","104, 112, LOCATION"}
6553	Authors should discuss the own results on the basis of the results observed by other Authors, and the discussion should not be presented  in isolation from the own results (e.g. lines 366-376).	{"138, 171, CONTENT","98, 112, CONTENT","178, 191, LOCATION","113, 123, MODAL","127, 136, ACTION","8, 22, ACTION","102, 112, LOCATION","8, 14, MODAL","14, 22, ACTION","22, 66, CONTENT","8, 14, MODAL"}

6555	As Authors did not include any assessment of sensory profile or consumer panel, some thesis are not justified (sub-chapter 4.5. – “… convenience, nutrition and taste”) and should be removed as they are not associated  with the objective of the study.	{"130, 166, LOCATION","11, 26, ACTION","111, 127, LOCATION","80, 91, CONTENT","182, 190, ACTION","172, 178, MODAL","172, 178, MODAL","96, 109, ACTION","26, 79, CONTENT","181, 216, ACTION"}
6556	The manuscript by Yan and co-workers introduces the preparation of magnetic porous carbon from bimetallic metal–organic frameworks, and its potential for norfloxacin removal from aqueous solutions. The topic is of interest to the readers of Nanomaterials. The research seems novel but it needs to be placed in context to the state-of-the-art. The manuscript has several minor and major technical and presentation issues, and therefore major revision is needed before further consideration.	{"299, 306, ACTION","281, 284, TRIGGER","256, 268, CONTENT","4, 14, LOCATION","306, 342, CONTENT","281, 285, TRIGGER","287, 294, MODAL","347, 357, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION"}
6557	1. Although mentioned in the title and Introduction section, the magnetic properties of the adsorbent have not been explored. The authors should demonstrate the advantage of the magnetic properties, and characterise it.	{"39, 59, LOCATION","29, 34, LOCATION","144, 157, ACTION","138, 144, MODAL","29, 34, LOCATION","138, 144, MODAL","203, 215, ACTION","157, 197, CONTENT"}
6558	2. The physicochemical characterisations (e.g., XRD, Raman, XPS, SEM, TEM, EDX) of the control adsorbent (magnetic carbon (MC) prepared by MOFs with only Co) is missing, and needs to be included in the manuscript.	{"2, 157, CONTENT","186, 194, ACTION","161, 168, ACTION","202, 212, LOCATION","174, 179, MODAL","202, 212, LOCATION"}
6559	3. In the last paragraph of the Introduction section, the authors made a hypothesis that“Co species can act as catalyst to improve the graphitization degree of MNPC”. However, there is no experimental proof to support it in this manuscript. Either provide evidence or refrain from making this conclusion.	{"10, 52, LOCATION","224, 239, LOCATION","88, 165, LOCATION","247, 255, ACTION","66, 70, ACTION","255, 265, CONTENT","15, 24, LOCATION","100, 103, MODAL","167, 174, TRIGGER","241, 247, TRIGGER","275, 303, CONTENT","267, 275, ACTION","166, 175, TRIGGER"}
6560	4. Figure 1 is incorrect. Both the top left and bottom left structures are incorrect. The structures should depict 2-methylimidazole. The chemical structure of MNPC in the bottom left of the figure shows a precise molecular structure which does not represent MNPC accurately. A schematic figure must not contain any scientifically incorrect information.	{"132, 164, CONTENT","3, 11, LOCATION","107, 114, ACTION","101, 107, MODAL","25, 70, CONTENT","86, 101, CONTENT","114, 132, CONTENT","234, 239, TRIGGER","2, 12, LOCATION","312, 353, CONTENT","234, 240, TRIGGER","101, 107, MODAL","203, 233, CONTENT","259, 263, CONTENT","197, 203, ACTION","71, 84, ACTION","12, 24, ACTION","276, 294, CONTENT","295, 303, MODAL","240, 258, ACTION","172, 197, LOCATION","304, 311, ACTION"}
6561	5. In the Synthesis of MNPC section where the mass of reagents were reported, the corresponding mole of reagents should be reported  as well, so that the readers have a clear understanding of the ratio of reagents used in the reaction, i.e. stoichiometry.	{"36, 112, CONTENT","10, 35, LOCATION","67, 76, ACTION","36, 41, TRIGGER","113, 119, MODAL","123, 133, ACTION","113, 119, MODAL"}
6562	6. The figure captions need to be more informative. For instance, in Figure 8, the authors need to include the experimental conditions (loading concentration, weight of adsorbent, solvent) because without these the removal rates have no meaning whatsoever. Similarly adjust the caption for Figure 10.	{"68, 78, LOCATION","99, 106, ACTION","22, 28, MODAL","91, 96, MODAL","273, 285, CONTENT","266, 273, ACTION","69, 77, LOCATION","31, 50, ACTION","7, 22, LOCATION","107, 188, CONTENT","290, 299, LOCATION"}
6564	8. Magnetic adsorbents are green as they can be separated  easily from the solution. This point should be emphasized and elaborated  on. There is a global initiative toward sustainable solutions, the sustainability of the presented methodology should be emphasized . Examples for sustainable adsorption including materials and process perspectives should be given in the introduction: Green Chem., 2017, 19, 3116-3125; Waste Management, 2011, 31, 1350-1356; Green Chem., 2015, 17, 5196-5205.	{"41, 44, MODAL","47, 57, ACTION","371, 383, LOCATION","106, 116, ACTION","121, 131, ACTION","267, 347, CONTENT","358, 363, ACTION","348, 354, MODAL","371, 383, LOCATION","385, 490, CONTENT","3, 83, CONTENT","96, 102, MODAL"}
6565	9. The discussion section (4) is short. One paragraph does not warrant to be an individual section. Merge this into the Results section. Figure 13 has no scientific meaning and does not add to the understanding of the manuscript, consequently it should be deleted .	{"7, 25, LOCATION","120, 135, LOCATION","7, 17, LOCATION","255, 263, ACTION","246, 252, MODAL","30, 38, ACTION","256, 263, ACTION","137, 147, LOCATION","246, 253, MODAL","100, 105, ACTION"}
6566	10. There is a typo in the first paragraph in the Introduction section:“cost and effective” should be replaced  by“cost-effective”.	{"14, 19, CONTENT","92, 98, MODAL","101, 110, ACTION","33, 42, LOCATION","92, 98, MODAL","102, 110, ACTION","114, 130, CONTENT","71, 91, LOCATION","27, 70, LOCATION"}

6568	12. Related reports on the use of pyrolysed bimetallic MOFs as adsorbents should be acknowledged , e.g., Journal of Chromatography A, 2017, 1479: 55-61 and Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 2018, 509: 245-253.	{"74, 80, MODAL","4, 73, CONTENT","73, 80, MODAL","84, 96, ACTION","83, 96, ACTION","105, 216, CONTENT"}
6569	13. In the second paragraph in the Introduction section, the authors mentioned that“developing multifunctional adsorbents with higher performance is still needed”. However, the adsorbent developed in the current work is used for adsorbing only one compound, norfloxacin.

Authors who did not participate in the manuscript preparing should be removed at all or just be presented  in Acknowledgements Section (if they contributed in any way). If they participated actively in the study and creating manuscript, as well as performed critical revisions of the manuscript and accepted the publication of the data, they should be indicated , but their contributions should be clearly specified .	{"412, 421, ACTION","722, 731, ACTION","137, 148, ACTION","19, 40, ACTION","46, 72, CONTENT","73, 78, TRIGGER","82, 91, ACTION","102, 131, LOCATION","133, 136, CONTENT","181, 191, TRIGGER","149, 179, CONTENT","192, 212, CONTENT","253, 265, CONTENT","276, 289, ACTION","294, 301, LOCATION","386, 393, ACTION","401, 403, TRIGGER","426, 450, LOCATION","316, 375, CONTENT","455, 482, CONTENT","452, 455, TRIGGER","488, 651, CONTENT","157, 167, LOCATION","275, 289, ACTION","266, 272, MODAL","73, 78, TRIGGER","266, 273, MODAL","658, 664, MODAL","485, 487, TRIGGER","668, 677, ACTION","690, 703, CONTENT","704, 710, MODAL","376, 383, MODAL"}
6606	As Authors present the validation of EAT5 FFQ food frequency questionnaire, it is essential for readers to be able to get familiar with this tool. It should be presented  as a supplementary material, as readers should not be forced  to look for it in other publications or ask authors if they want to analyse the article and the tool.	{"150, 156, MODAL","176, 189, LOCATION","150, 157, MODAL","160, 171, ACTION","211, 218, MODAL","37, 74, LOCATION","159, 169, ACTION","171, 198, CONTENT","233, 333, CONTENT","200, 202, TRIGGER","218, 231, ACTION"}
6607	Authors should remember that for the validation of the FFQs, analysis of correlation is not a preferable method. It may be applied  as an additional one, but in the Abstract, Authors should present mainly the most important results, including those resulting from the analysis of Bland-Altman plots.	{"132, 152, CONTENT","233, 242, ACTION","243, 298, CONTENT","154, 157, TRIGGER","205, 231, CONTENT","123, 130, ACTION","33, 59, CONTENT","61, 84, CONTENT","88, 104, ACTION","105, 111, CONTENT","15, 23, ACTION","24, 32, TRIGGER","8, 14, MODAL","105, 111, LOCATION","122, 130, ACTION","8, 14, MODAL","154, 157, TRIGGER","183, 189, MODAL","190, 198, ACTION","165, 173, LOCATION","116, 120, MODAL"}
6608	Authors properly justified the study, but should present a little bit broader perspective – for an international reader.

6609	It is understandable, that the conducted analysis is a part of a broader study but Authors should not present the irrelevant elements in their manuscript – e.g. Authors indicated how was the weight, height measured and BMI calculated, but afterwards they did not use this data in their manuscript – such information should be removed  for better communicativeness of the manuscript.	{"339, 363, CONTENT","325, 333, ACTION","98, 109, ACTION","91, 97, MODAL","79, 82, TRIGGER","91, 97, MODAL","326, 335, ACTION","371, 381, LOCATION","143, 153, LOCATION","316, 323, MODAL","299, 315, CONTENT","286, 296, LOCATION","267, 276, CONTENT","161, 233, CONTENT","143, 153, LOCATION","114, 133, CONTENT","255, 266, ACTION","79, 82, TRIGGER","235, 249, TRIGGER"}
6610	Sub-section 2.3. – as indicated above – readers should receive more specific information about applied FFQ (the frequencies, serving sizes, included products, groupings, etc.) – the FFQ applied for the study should be presented  as a supplementary material	{"234, 256, LOCATION","55, 63, ACTION","208, 214, MODAL","178, 207, CONTENT","48, 55, MODAL","0, 16, LOCATION","48, 54, MODAL","217, 227, ACTION","218, 229, ACTION","63, 175, CONTENT","4, 15, LOCATION"}
6611	Authors should apply mainly the methods which are recommended for validation of the FFQs, while other should be indicated  as additional ones. Authors may address the recommendations of Cade (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12186666) in order to indicate in their Materials and Methods section, as well as other sections, proper perspective – they should focus on the most prominent results.	{"8, 14, MODAL","352, 359, MODAL","326, 344, CONTENT","250, 259, ACTION","155, 163, ACTION","151, 154, MODAL","15, 21, ACTION","102, 109, MODAL","112, 121, ACTION","111, 121, ACTION","8, 14, MODAL","40, 45, TRIGGER","90, 96, TRIGGER","126, 141, CONTENT","367, 394, CONTENT","359, 367, ACTION","310, 324, LOCATION","299, 309, TRIGGER","268, 297, LOCATION","238, 249, TRIGGER","163, 237, CONTENT","123, 125, TRIGGER","96, 101, CONTENT","28, 88, CONTENT"}

6613	While interpreting Bland-Altman plots, Authors should present the relevant criteria – they cannot state that their plots“indicated reasonably consistent agreement” but with no numeric criteria, based on the subjective visual assessment only. They can e.g. calculate Bland-Altman index and compare it with the 5% level (or alternatively with the 10% borderline significant level).	{"91, 94, MODAL","47, 61, ACTION","120, 163, LOCATION","256, 266, ACTION","47, 54, MODAL","54, 62, ACTION","266, 284, CONTENT","289, 296, ACTION","247, 251, MODAL","164, 167, TRIGGER","300, 304, TRIGGER","6, 37, CONTENT","297, 299, CONTENT","62, 83, CONTENT","0, 5, TRIGGER","104, 108, TRIGGER","173, 192, CONTENT","168, 172, TRIGGER","109, 120, LOCATION","236, 240, TRIGGER","194, 235, CONTENT","91, 97, MODAL","98, 103, ACTION","164, 167, TRIGGER","120, 163, LOCATION","305, 378, CONTENT"}
6614	There is an important limitation of the study which is the fact that there were a food items in the FFQ that were from more than one NOVA category – it should be extensively discussed in terms of what should be done for better applicability of assessed FFQ for indicated  aim.	{"12, 32, CONTENT","201, 275, CONTENT","55, 146, CONTENT","196, 200, TRIGGER","46, 54, TRIGGER","152, 158, MODAL","161, 270, ACTION","40, 45, LOCATION","174, 184, ACTION","152, 159, MODAL","46, 51, TRIGGER"}
6615	There are some limitations of the study which were underestimated. Authors focused mainly on the strengths, while especially limitations should be listed and extensively discussed  (e.g. overestimation of energy intake – is it known if it results from overestimation of all the products or only some of them?, etc.).	{"137, 143, MODAL","137, 144, MODAL","40, 45, TRIGGER","146, 179, ACTION","147, 154, ACTION","170, 181, ACTION","187, 307, CONTENT","34, 40, LOCATION","125, 137, CONTENT","15, 26, CONTENT"}

6617	The manuscript presents a computer-aided design of imprinted scavengers. The work is of interest to a broader audience from the sensor, imprinting, molecular recognition and environmental fields. The work is novel, however, setting the background needs to be improved, grammar mistakes and informal language must be corrected , and some scientific details need clarification. Suggested improvements are outlined below.	{"308, 312, MODAL","4, 14, LOCATION","337, 355, CONTENT","316, 325, ACTION","308, 313, MODAL","269, 307, CONTENT","259, 267, ACTION","315, 325, ACTION","4, 15, LOCATION","215, 222, TRIGGER","356, 360, MODAL","215, 222, TRIGGER","361, 374, ACTION","247, 255, MODAL","224, 246, CONTENT"}
6618	1) The word“molecular” can be removed  from the title of the manuscript. Avoid informal and vague language such as“matched the DCD molecules very well”,“are relatively uniform”,“result maybe indicates”,“the rest calculations”.	{"48, 71, LOCATION","11, 22, LOCATION","79, 106, CONTENT","107, 114, TRIGGER","115, 151, LOCATION","152, 176, LOCATION","177, 201, LOCATION","202, 225, LOCATION","73, 78, ACTION","30, 39, ACTION","23, 27, MODAL","11, 22, LOCATION","29, 37, ACTION","23, 26, MODAL"}
6619	2) The abstract is somewhat vague. Statements such as“the best functional monomer” and“the best cross-linker” should be rephrased  in a more accurate way. They are“best” in what way? There are several criteria for monomers and cross-linkers.	{"23, 27, TRIGGER","7, 16, LOCATION","110, 117, MODAL","119, 129, ACTION","120, 129, ACTION","131, 153, CONTENT","110, 116, MODAL","7, 15, LOCATION","170, 181, CONTENT","28, 33, ACTION","35, 45, CONTENT","46, 53, TRIGGER","53, 82, LOCATION","86, 109, LOCATION","163, 169, LOCATION","155, 163, TRIGGER"}
6620	3) The authors propose DCD:MAA to be 1:5 ratio. How does such an interaction happen involving only one DCD and 5 MAA?

6621	4) Molecular imprinting is more than 40 years old and thus the statement that it is a“new technology” (line 35) should be reconsidered .	{"121, 134, ACTION","103, 110, LOCATION","122, 134, ACTION","112, 119, MODAL","112, 118, MODAL","63, 72, LOCATION","3, 49, CONTENT","59, 85, CONTENT","85, 101, LOCATION","54, 58, TRIGGER"}

6624	7) In Line 83-84 the calculation methods are listed. On what basis were these methods selected? Some justification and brief comparison of the selected methods need to be included in the manuscript.	{"101, 114, ACTION","187, 197, LOCATION","56, 60, TRIGGER","61, 94, CONTENT","125, 135, ACTION","136, 159, CONTENT","160, 167, MODAL","6, 16, LOCATION","171, 179, ACTION","21, 40, CONTENT","6, 16, LOCATION","56, 60, TRIGGER"}
6625	8) Previous reports on the imprinting of the same template for the same purpose should be acknowledged  in the introduction section (Biosensors and Bioelectronics, 2016, 77, 512–517; Talanta, 2015, 134, 761?767).	{"111, 131, LOCATION","80, 86, MODAL","89, 102, ACTION","90, 102, ACTION","3, 79, CONTENT","133, 210, CONTENT","80, 87, MODAL","111, 123, LOCATION"}
6626	9) Limited examples (lines 45-56) for the application areas of imprinting are given which should be complemented  with recent works on drug delivery (ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 2015, 7 (18), 9516–9525), proteomics (Chem. Asian J. 2009, 4, 286–293), and wastewater treatment (Green Chem., 2015, 17, 5196-5205).	{"100, 112, ACTION","84, 89, TRIGGER","90, 96, MODAL","99, 112, ACTION","21, 32, LOCATION","34, 73, CONTENT","3, 19, CONTENT","119, 310, CONTENT","90, 96, MODAL","21, 32, LOCATION"}
6627	10) Table 2 shows only some template:functional monomer ratios. Data for 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4 and 1:5 ratios should be included in the table to demonstrate that indeed  the 1:5 DCD:MAA is the best choice for the preparation of the imprinted polymers.	{"64, 107, CONTENT","4, 11, LOCATION","107, 113, MODAL","4, 11, LOCATION","117, 125, ACTION","116, 165, ACTION","107, 113, MODAL","12, 22, ACTION","133, 138, LOCATION","142, 153, ACTION","154, 158, TRIGGER","159, 247, CONTENT","23, 62, CONTENT"}

6629	12) Figure 4, panel B, the ratios on the x axis are insufficient to interpret the data. It should be clarified what those ratios actually are. The caption of Figure 4 needs to include the conditions for adsorption (e.g. solvent, feed concentration, amount of adsorbent, time…)	{"143, 166, LOCATION","4, 12, LOCATION","100, 110, ACTION","91, 97, MODAL","111, 115, TRIGGER","4, 21, LOCATION","101, 111, ACTION","91, 98, MODAL","176, 183, ACTION","41, 47, LOCATION","167, 172, MODAL","184, 276, CONTENT","65, 86, CONTENT","23, 33, CONTENT","52, 64, ACTION","116, 141, CONTENT","111, 115, TRIGGER"}
6630	13) 1:5 molar ratio represents a significant excess of MAA compared to the template. At such concentrations self-association of MAA can occur. Was self-association taken into account for the calculations? If yes data should be shown, if not then at least the possibility of self-association of MAA functional monomer should be mentioned and relevant literature cited  (Spectrochim. Acta, Part A, 170 (2017) 69–76).	{"4, 19, LOCATION","237, 240, CONTENT","147, 203, CONTENT","208, 211, CONTENT","241, 245, TRIGGER","246, 316, CONTENT","337, 340, TRIGGER","143, 146, TRIGGER","132, 136, MODAL","217, 224, MODAL","227, 232, ACTION","317, 324, MODAL","327, 337, ACTION","341, 413, CONTENT","234, 236, TRIGGER","205, 208, TRIGGER","212, 216, CONTENT","326, 366, ACTION","40, 43, MODAL"}
6631	14) Section 3.3 describes a bulk polymerisation procedure which leads to monolith forms which are then crushed to achieve random particles but the authors show microspheres on Figure 5.

6632	The review article by Ang and co-workers gives an overview of a subfield of natural coagulants. There is a need for such a review from the angle chosen by the authors. The topic fits well within the scope of the journal. However, there is room for improvement, the context and background need to be improved, and more aspects of the topic included. This reviewer recommends major revision to address the points below before a final decision can be made.	{"299, 307, ACTION","221, 228, TRIGGER","288, 292, MODAL","221, 228, TRIGGER","309, 347, CONTENT","265, 287, CONTENT","441, 444, MODAL"}
6633	1, Some critical analysis on the greenness/sustainability of the presented methodologies should be added . For instance what are the green extraction technologies? Which are the currently employed techniques that pose a significant environmental burden, and are there any alternatives? These discussions would also help to show the way forward for the subject field.	{"315, 319, ACTION","320, 365, CONTENT","120, 124, TRIGGER","89, 95, MODAL","98, 104, ACTION","89, 96, MODAL","99, 104, ACTION","304, 310, MODAL","120, 162, CONTENT","286, 303, CONTENT","169, 284, CONTENT","164, 169, TRIGGER","3, 88, CONTENT"}
6634	2, Biopolymers are compounds and not approaches. Therefore the title should be revised , for instance ‘biopolymers as Green Solutions for…’ or ‘biopolymers as Green Coagulants for…’ might be better expressions.	{"102, 209, CONTENT","78, 86, ACTION","63, 68, LOCATION","63, 69, LOCATION","79, 86, ACTION","69, 76, MODAL","69, 75, MODAL"}
6635	3, There were three related reviews published in 2014, 2017 and 2020 under DOIs 10.1016/j.jes.2014.09.024, 10.14445/23488352/IJCE-V4I3P109 and 10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.121267. The authors should mention these and explain what novelty their manuscript has compared to the existing  reviews in the literature. Their complementary nature should be mentioned .	{"193, 201, ACTION","219, 223, TRIGGER","186, 192, MODAL","192, 277, ACTION","238, 248, LOCATION","306, 332, CONTENT","343, 353, ACTION","333, 340, MODAL","201, 304, CONTENT","14, 172, CONTENT","186, 193, MODAL"}
6636	4, The title of section 2 is ‘Production of natural coagulants’ but most of the examples in this part of the review are literature-based and in research stage at lab-scale without any proven large-scale production. The word production is misleading in the title and instead ‘obtaining’, ‘preparation’ or something similar should be used .	{"322, 328, MODAL","7, 25, LOCATION","332, 336, ACTION","7, 12, LOCATION","322, 328, MODAL","64, 67, TRIGGER","331, 336, ACTION","64, 67, TRIGGER","215, 234, CONTENT","273, 321, CONTENT","256, 261, LOCATION","235, 248, ACTION","29, 63, LOCATION","266, 273, TRIGGER"}
6637	5, The introduction is relatively short and does not set the scene. It starts in medias res without placing the topic of water treatment in context. Some general background and examples, trends should be given as outlined  below.	{"21, 39, ACTION","7, 19, LOCATION","149, 193, CONTENT","204, 210, ACTION","194, 200, MODAL","7, 19, LOCATION","203, 221, ACTION","194, 200, MODAL"}
6638	6, Mention briefly the trend towards green and sustainable water treatment, which is an increasingly important topic, and mention examples from different sectors such as microbial fuel cells (DOI 10.1039/C3EE43106A), adsorption (10.1039/C5GC01937K), nanogenerators (10.1002/aenm.201501778), natural waste (10.1002/ep.11750), electrodialysis (10.1039/C8TA09160A), bioreactors (10.22207/JPAM.13.1.41), microalgae (10.1007/978-981-13-2264-8_22).	{"130, 441, CONTENT","76, 81, TRIGGER","3, 11, ACTION","122, 130, ACTION","19, 116, CONTENT"}
6639	7, The use of biopolymers and plant based materials for green purposes should be exemplified  as their use has been increasing, and they penetrate into various fields (keratin 10.1039/C9GC03896E, bamboo 10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b02516; lotus leaf 10.1039/C9GC03254A; fatty acid 10.1002/adma.201703702; biocoatings 10.1021/acsapm.8b00161; polyglucose 10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b03219; ). These examples will help to demonstrate their widespread use and set the background/context.	{"3, 70, CONTENT","94, 380, CONTENT","382, 396, CONTENT","397, 401, MODAL","402, 406, ACTION","407, 473, CONTENT","81, 92, ACTION","71, 77, MODAL","71, 77, MODAL","80, 92, ACTION"}
6640	8, The authors should add a table with emerging  biopolymers and natural materials that have not been used for this purpose but have a good potential and should be explored  in the future. Again this would help to show the way forward and would improve the manuscript by adding  future perspective.	{"200, 205, MODAL","239, 245, MODAL","206, 211, ACTION","245, 253, ACTION","257, 268, LOCATION","211, 234, CONTENT","268, 297, CONTENT","22, 25, ACTION","154, 161, MODAL","164, 174, ACTION","28, 149, CONTENT","15, 21, MODAL","124, 127, TRIGGER","21, 47, ACTION","257, 267, LOCATION","15, 22, MODAL","189, 195, TRIGGER"}
6641	9, Some of the natural coagulants works (including modelling studies) are missing from the review and the authors should mention them in the relevant places, DOIs 10.5402/2011/632189, 10.4172/2157-7463.1000374, modelling 10.5004/dwt.2019.23871, modelling 10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.117622.	{"70, 81, ACTION","3, 69, CONTENT","114, 121, MODAL","114, 128, ACTION","129, 284, CONTENT","121, 129, ACTION","91, 98, LOCATION"}

6643	11, Some critical aspects should be added  in the manuscript, for instance by mentioning the disadvantages and how to overcome them, see DOI 10.2166/ws.2007.144.	{"75, 160, CONTENT","4, 25, CONTENT","50, 60, LOCATION","26, 33, MODAL","36, 43, ACTION","50, 60, LOCATION","35, 41, ACTION","26, 32, MODAL","111, 114, TRIGGER"}
6644	The manuscript entitled“Effect of Bolus Insulin Administration, Followed by a Continuous Insulin Infusion, on Diabetic Ketoacidosis Management” presents interesting issue, but some important corrections are needed.	{"203, 213, ACTION","176, 202, CONTENT","172, 175, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","172, 175, TRIGGER","23, 143, LOCATION"}
6645	Authors presented the information, that their study“was exempt by the Institutional Review Board”, but with no details – who made the exemption and why? which specific Institutional Review Board was engaged? did the exactly Institutional Review Board made the exemption and if so, what is the reference (number of decision)?	{"51, 97, LOCATION","121, 124, TRIGGER","159, 206, CONTENT","153, 158, TRIGGER","99, 102, TRIGGER","108, 118, ACTION","281, 286, TRIGGER","208, 269, CONTENT","125, 151, CONTENT","293, 323, CONTENT","99, 102, TRIGGER","51, 97, LOCATION","46, 51, LOCATION"}
6646	In general, in the case of studies involving human subjects, the agreement of the ethics committee is compulsory – as it is defined:‘No one should participate in research unless independent review concludes that the risks are reasonable in relation to the potential benefits.’ (National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) - https://bioethicsarchive.georgetown.edu/nbac/human/oversumm.html).	{"132, 276, LOCATION","140, 146, MODAL","12, 98, CONTENT","132, 391, CONTENT","99, 112, ACTION"}

6649	Authors should correct their language into more brief and scientific one (e.g. instead of“see table 3”, they should indicate“the results are presented in Table 3”).	{"89, 102, LOCATION","109, 115, MODAL","124, 162, CONTENT","79, 89, TRIGGER","89, 102, LOCATION","8, 15, MODAL","23, 72, CONTENT","15, 23, ACTION","116, 124, ACTION","8, 22, ACTION","8, 14, MODAL"}

6655	Authors should broaden the section, in order to properly justify the study and to present all the necessary details, e.g. what is the characteristics of DKA, what are the reasons of DKA, what are the consequences of DKA, what are the recommendations for DKA individuals (Authors presented only the American ones), etc.	{"187, 191, TRIGGER","27, 34, LOCATION","15, 23, ACTION","8, 15, MODAL","163, 185, CONTENT","8, 14, MODAL","127, 157, CONTENT","122, 126, TRIGGER","158, 163, TRIGGER","192, 219, CONTENT","122, 127, TRIGGER","221, 226, TRIGGER","226, 312, CONTENT","36, 116, CONTENT"}

6659	The very important problem is no information about procedure of choosing the treatment for patients -  how was the choice of patients to groups made (randomly or using any criteria?).

6661	The exclusion criteria seem to be controversial – Authors should precisely describe what were the reasons to not apply the recommended treatment in the case of some assessed individuals.

Sci., 2011, 34, 217-224; Lucci et al, J. Sep. Sci., 2017, 40, 458-465).	{"20, 27, MODAL","27, 39, ACTION","7, 19, LOCATION","39, 399, CONTENT","20, 26, MODAL","7, 19, LOCATION"}
6742	5) Acetic acid-methanol was applied for desorption of patulin which is a cyclic ester. Did the authors notice any degradation of patulin (ring opening and transesterification)?	{"62, 67, TRIGGER","87, 91, TRIGGER","103, 175, CONTENT"}
6743	6) Was the reusability of the imprinted polymers evaluated? Imprinted polymers, especially the ones crosslinked with DVB are stable over a long time and can be reused  (Kupai et al. Polym. Chem., 2017, 8, 666–673) which should be mentioned  in the manuscript.	{"7, 58, CONTENT","2, 6, TRIGGER","230, 241, ACTION","60, 148, CONTENT","169, 212, CONTENT","153, 156, MODAL","214, 219, TRIGGER","248, 258, LOCATION","159, 166, ACTION","153, 157, MODAL","160, 166, ACTION","220, 226, MODAL","248, 258, LOCATION"}
6744	7) After line 120, the authors should mention that molecular imprinting  has not only been used for analytical purposes but also for large scale environmental applications recently (Razali et al. Green Chem., 2015, 17, 5196–5205) and consequently the novel patulin-imprinted polymers could potentially be used for detoxification of fruit juices besides the analytical application.	{"31, 38, MODAL","9, 17, LOCATION","37, 71, ACTION","284, 289, MODAL","120, 123, TRIGGER","38, 45, ACTION","3, 17, LOCATION","284, 290, MODAL","305, 310, ACTION","314, 379, CONTENT","247, 283, CONTENT","46, 229, CONTENT"}
6745	8) For the general statement in line 129 ref [5] should be replaced  with a recent review or book chapter on the topic, e.g. Chen et al. Chem. Soc. Rev., 2016, 45, 2137–2211.	{"41, 48, LOCATION","49, 55, MODAL","58, 67, ACTION","49, 56, MODAL","59, 69, ACTION","32, 40, LOCATION","69, 174, CONTENT","19, 28, LOCATION"}
6746	9) The different compositions for the imprinted polymers should be presented  in a table.	{"57, 63, MODAL","66, 76, ACTION","67, 78, ACTION","57, 64, MODAL","78, 88, CONTENT","3, 56, CONTENT"}
6747	10) The adsorption capacities and recoveries should be presented  in the manuscript. Basically there is no data/results presented in the manuscript in its current version.	{"4, 44, CONTENT","54, 64, ACTION","73, 83, LOCATION","45, 51, MODAL","55, 66, ACTION","45, 52, MODAL","137, 147, LOCATION","73, 83, LOCATION"}
6748	11) What was the LOD/LOQ of the MS method for the detection of the analyte?	{"35, 41, LOCATION","4, 8, TRIGGER","9, 74, CONTENT","4, 8, TRIGGER"}
6749	12) The conclusion section needs to include quantitative details, the limitations and drawbacks of the proposed methodology should be mentioned .	{"66, 123, CONTENT","44, 64, CONTENT","124, 131, MODAL","124, 130, MODAL","8, 26, LOCATION","8, 18, LOCATION","133, 143, ACTION","27, 32, MODAL","134, 144, ACTION","36, 44, ACTION"}
6750	13) What is the theoretical maximum number of binding sites in unit mass of polymers (based on the template amount used for polymer preparation)? How does this value compare with the observed adsorption capacity?	{"4, 8, TRIGGER","146, 150, TRIGGER","4, 9, TRIGGER","9, 144, CONTENT","150, 211, CONTENT"}
6751	The manuscript entitled“Sleep duration is inversely associated with serum uric acid concentrations and uric acid to creatinine ratio in an elderly Mediterranean population at high cardiovascular risk” presents interesting issue, but it requires some corrections before being published.	{"245, 261, CONTENT","23, 200, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","229, 232, TRIGGER","229, 233, TRIGGER","236, 245, ACTION"}
6752	One major ethical problem is associated with the authorship. It is understandable that in case of a large study there are a number of authors (there are 52 Authors of the prepared manuscript), but all of them must participate actively in the manuscript preparation. All Authors must at least participate in critical review of the manuscript (if not participate in writing it).	{"304, 375, CONTENT","193, 197, TRIGGER","193, 196, TRIGGER","209, 213, MODAL","209, 214, MODAL","180, 190, LOCATION","226, 264, CONTENT","292, 304, ACTION","278, 282, MODAL","214, 226, ACTION","180, 190, LOCATION"}
6753	1.      Based on Authors Contributions section, in fact there are only 2 Authors who prepared the manuscript (as specified – CP and JSS analysed the data and wrote the manuscript). But majority of other Authors only participated in data gathering. In such situation, if they did not participate in manuscript preparation, they should not be indicated  as authors, but rather mentioned in Acknowledgements section.	{"364, 368, TRIGGER","298, 320, CONTENT","275, 294, ACTION","181, 184, TRIGGER","98, 109, LOCATION","17, 46, LOCATION","388, 412, LOCATION","267, 270, TRIGGER","327, 333, MODAL","375, 385, ACTION","341, 350, ACTION","98, 108, LOCATION","340, 350, ACTION","181, 184, TRIGGER","327, 337, MODAL"}
6754	2.      Based on Authors Contributions section, there are some Authors (e.g. NBT) who did nothing for the study and did nothing for the manuscript preparation (is not indicated in Authors Contributions section at all). Such persons should be not indicated  as Author of the study	{"136, 146, LOCATION","162, 176, ACTION","232, 238, MODAL","274, 279, LOCATION","246, 257, ACTION","17, 46, LOCATION","219, 231, CONTENT","232, 245, MODAL","58, 217, CONTENT"}
6755	Authors should remember, that the“guest authorship” is the forbidden procedure. Authors who did not participate in the manuscript preparing should be removed at all or just be presented  in Acknowledgements Section. If they participated actively in the study and creating manuscript, as well as performed critical revisions of the manuscript and accepted the publication of the data, they should be indicated , but their contributions should be clearly specified .	{"80, 139, CONTENT","421, 434, CONTENT","30, 78, CONTENT","216, 382, CONTENT","453, 463, ACTION","435, 442, MODAL","411, 415, TRIGGER","399, 409, ACTION","411, 414, TRIGGER","8, 14, MODAL","149, 185, ACTION","33, 51, LOCATION","190, 214, LOCATION","8, 15, MODAL","15, 23, ACTION","140, 147, MODAL","150, 158, ACTION","176, 187, ACTION","389, 396, MODAL"}
6757	2.      Moreover, manuscript was not prepared according to the instructions for authors (e.g. numbering of chapters, not continuous line numbering, References section).	{"8, 16, TRIGGER","18, 29, LOCATION","18, 28, LOCATION","45, 167, CONTENT","29, 45, ACTION"}
6758	3.      Authors must precisely formulate their observations, in order to present what exactly is being observed, e.g. instead of“sleep duration is associated with lower SUA concentrations”, it should be either“longer sleep duration is associated with lower SUA concentrations”, or“sleep duration is associated with SUA concentrations”, or“sleep duration is inversely associated with SUA concentrations”	{"81, 85, TRIGGER","41, 111, CONTENT","31, 41, ACTION","16, 21, MODAL","200, 203, ACTION","193, 200, MODAL","128, 188, LOCATION","16, 20, MODAL","210, 276, CONTENT","117, 128, TRIGGER","338, 402, CONTENT","278, 280, TRIGGER","280, 334, CONTENT","336, 338, TRIGGER","128, 188, LOCATION"}

6764	Authors should justify the decided categories of sleep duration (e.g. reference is needed).	{"15, 23, ACTION","8, 22, ACTION","8, 15, MODAL","23, 90, CONTENT"}
6765	It seems, that Authors did not verify the normality of distribution for the assessed variables.

6766	If the distribution is normal, the mean values should be presented  (accompanied by SD), but if it is different than normal, the median, accompanied by minimum and maximum values should be presented  – it should be specified  that distribution is normal if it is.	{"56, 66, ACTION","179, 186, MODAL","57, 68, ACTION","215, 226, ACTION","13, 16, TRIGGER","47, 53, MODAL","226, 262, CONTENT","189, 200, ACTION","0, 2, TRIGGER","47, 54, MODAL","205, 212, MODAL","125, 178, CONTENT","69, 86, CONTENT","31, 46, CONTENT","89, 95, TRIGGER"}

6774	The manuscript by Li and co-workers investigates a SWIS. The topic is of interest to both professionals and academics working in the field wastewater treatment. The work fits well within the scope of the journal, however the novelty needs to be clarified, the context needs to be broadened, and some technical aspects need to be improved. There are several issues that must be addressed  prior to further consideration by IJERPH. The manuscript needs to be reconsidered after having carefully addressed the comments listed below:	{"329, 337, ACTION","470, 529, CONTENT","457, 470, ACTION","445, 451, MODAL","434, 445, LOCATION","349, 363, CONTENT","377, 388, ACTION","369, 373, MODAL","318, 322, MODAL","280, 289, ACTION","268, 273, MODAL","213, 220, TRIGGER","369, 373, MODAL","376, 386, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION","245, 254, ACTION","233, 239, MODAL","213, 221, TRIGGER","294, 317, CONTENT","4, 14, LOCATION","221, 232, CONTENT","256, 267, CONTENT"}
6775	1. In the title, correct“system” to“systems”.	{"35, 44, CONTENT","24, 32, LOCATION","10, 15, LOCATION","10, 15, LOCATION","17, 24, ACTION"}
6776	2. The results section has an extensive amount of references. After each result a reference is given. This is confusing and implies that all the observations were already made in the literature, which leads to the conclusion that the manuscript lacks novelty. The authors should explicitly mention what new observation were made by the authors and supported by new data presented in the submitted manuscript.	{"195, 200, TRIGGER","272, 279, MODAL","214, 224, LOCATION","272, 278, MODAL","290, 298, ACTION","298, 369, CONTENT","397, 407, LOCATION","234, 245, LOCATION","7, 22, LOCATION"}
6777	3. Avoid using the ambiguous formatting for units (x/y, and use of dots), and follow the IUPAC recommendation which is x y^-1 throughout the manuscript, including figures and tables.	{"163, 170, LOCATION","175, 181, LOCATION","9, 125, CONTENT","110, 115, TRIGGER","141, 151, LOCATION","141, 151, LOCATION","3, 9, ACTION"}
6779	5. The increasing demand and trend for sustainable wastewater treatment should be mentioned  in the introduction and examples given: Green Chem. 2015, 17, 5196-5205; Energy Environ. Sci. 2014, 7, 911-924. This will help to broaden the scope of the manuscript.	{"133, 203, CONTENT","210, 214, MODAL","3, 71, CONTENT","248, 258, LOCATION","117, 125, CONTENT","126, 131, ACTION","72, 79, MODAL","82, 93, ACTION","100, 113, LOCATION","72, 78, MODAL","81, 91, ACTION","100, 112, LOCATION"}
6780	6. Reproducibility of the experiments was demonstrated. The derivation of the error bars need to be explained in the text.	{"117, 121, LOCATION","100, 110, ACTION","117, 121, LOCATION","89, 93, MODAL","56, 88, CONTENT"}
6781	7. Avoid vague statements without much information content, such as“observed ORP were significant for pollutant removal”,“the SWIS performed well”. These statements should be quantitative and not qualitative.	{"175, 187, ACTION","9, 58, CONTENT","67, 120, LOCATION","3, 9, ACTION","148, 164, CONTENT","121, 146, LOCATION","192, 207, CONTENT","165, 171, MODAL","67, 120, LOCATION","165, 171, MODAL"}
6782	8. The authors should mention the use of software-assisted experimental design of purification systems to encourage their use; and give some recent filtration examples from the literature using DoE optimization approach: ACS Catal., 2018, 8, 7430-7438; J. Membr. Sci., 2015, 493, 568-579. These optimization processes could be applied  in the future in SWIS systems. This will help to broaden the scope of the manuscript.	{"34, 125, CONTENT","15, 22, MODAL","318, 323, MODAL","15, 29, ACTION","410, 420, LOCATION","410, 420, LOCATION","327, 336, ACTION","318, 323, MODAL","141, 287, CONTENT","131, 136, ACTION","22, 30, ACTION","372, 376, MODAL","339, 365, CONTENT"}

6785	11. The numbering of figures is confusing. If a single figure has several panels they need to be presented as a group and need to have a single figure caption.	{"4, 28, CONTENT","122, 126, MODAL","29, 41, ACTION","86, 90, MODAL","130, 134, ACTION","48, 80, CONTENT","107, 117, CONTENT","137, 158, CONTENT","21, 28, LOCATION","43, 46, TRIGGER","97, 107, ACTION"}
6786	12. There are several missing spaces throughout the manuscript.	{"52, 62, LOCATION","52, 62, LOCATION","30, 36, CONTENT","22, 29, ACTION"}
6787	13. Refrain from using“et al” in the reference list, instead list the names of all authors. There is inconsistency in the formatting of the references. Follow the journal guideline and proofread the list.	{"195, 203, CONTENT","140, 150, LOCATION","159, 180, CONTENT","37, 51, LOCATION","22, 29, LOCATION","53, 61, TRIGGER","4, 12, ACTION","61, 90, CONTENT","152, 158, ACTION","185, 194, ACTION","22, 29, LOCATION"}
6788	14. The latest achievements on the study of infiltration systems should be mentioned  in the manuscript: Journal of Environmental Management, 2017, 197, 476-489; Ecological Engineering, 2018, 123, 168-174. This will help to broaden the scope of the manuscript.	{"93, 103, LOCATION","65, 72, MODAL","65, 71, MODAL","93, 103, LOCATION","74, 84, ACTION","249, 259, LOCATION","105, 205, CONTENT","75, 86, ACTION","4, 64, CONTENT","211, 215, MODAL"}
6789	The novel work by Silva et al. is of interest to the analytical chemistry community. The work is detailed enough to ensure understanding, the majority of the manuscript reads well and built in a logical manner. Nonetheless, the manuscript needs to be improved and some points clarified prior to publication. The introduction is too narrow and needs to discuss the broader context for which recommendations have been given, and the data representation needs some corrections.	{"211, 222, TRIGGER","312, 324, LOCATION","462, 473, ACTION","426, 450, CONTENT","360, 421, CONTENT","325, 338, ACTION","251, 260, ACTION","451, 457, MODAL","352, 360, ACTION","343, 349, MODAL","264, 275, CONTENT","276, 286, ACTION","239, 245, MODAL","228, 239, LOCATION","158, 168, LOCATION","384, 389, TRIGGER"}
6790	1) The manuscript needs to be revised in terms of typos and grammar mistakes, e.g. line 22: concomitantly should read concomitant; line 23: its should read their; line 53: of should read on; line 66: several should read severe (?); line 85-89: superscripts are missing for the units; line 100: dot missing; line 145: space missing before the unit; line 397: double dot;	{"144, 151, MODAL","151, 155, ACTION","156, 161, CONTENT","163, 170, LOCATION","106, 112, MODAL","7, 17, LOCATION","358, 368, CONTENT","331, 346, CONTENT","317, 323, CONTENT","323, 331, ACTION","298, 305, ACTION","294, 298, CONTENT","269, 282, CONTENT","244, 257, CONTENT","220, 226, CONTENT","187, 189, CONTENT","182, 187, ACTION","257, 268, ACTION","215, 220, ACTION","175, 182, MODAL","18, 24, MODAL","208, 215, MODAL","348, 356, LOCATION","307, 315, LOCATION","30, 37, ACTION","284, 292, LOCATION","38, 76, CONTENT","7, 18, LOCATION","83, 90, LOCATION","106, 112, MODAL","113, 118, ACTION","232, 242, LOCATION","118, 129, CONTENT","191, 198, LOCATION","131, 138, LOCATION","200, 207, LOCATION","92, 105, LOCATION","172, 175, LOCATION"}

6805	The manuscript by Muthana and co-workers details the fabrication, characterization and application of new polymer blend nanofiltration membranes. The results are new and of interest to the readers of Membranes. The work has a good potential impact. On the other hand, there are several issues with the manuscript that must be addressed  prior to further consideration by the journal.	{"302, 312, LOCATION","278, 292, CONTENT","4, 15, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","318, 322, MODAL","326, 337, ACTION","325, 335, ACTION","318, 323, MODAL"}
6806	1. The authors should clarify the rationale for the selection of the two polymers used to prepare the blends (PES and PPSU). Why PES was used as an additive and not vice versa?	{"15, 21, MODAL","22, 29, ACTION","15, 21, MODAL","129, 175, CONTENT","30, 123, CONTENT","125, 128, TRIGGER"}

6810	6. Why did the authors choose to operate at 3 bar? The usual nanofiltration range is 5 to 40 bar. 3 bar is really the lower end of the nanofiltration pressure range. Are the membranes stable at higher pressures?	{"41, 45, LOCATION","3, 6, TRIGGER","166, 210, CONTENT","7, 49, CONTENT"}
6811	7. The authors should also add a critical note that the manufacturing  of polymer membranes via phase inversion generates a significant amount of wastewater, which needs to be minimised and treated (Green Chem. 2015, 17, 5196-5205).	{"199, 230, CONTENT","31, 156, CONTENT","164, 170, MODAL","15, 22, MODAL","158, 163, TRIGGER","21, 69, ACTION","190, 197, ACTION","176, 186, ACTION","27, 31, ACTION"}

6851	The review by Hasanah and co-workers gives an overview of the different polymerization techniques for the synthesis of imprinted materials. The topic fits well the scope of the journal, and it is of interest to a broad audience from various fields such as polymer chemists, analytical chemists, chemical engineers and materials scientists. The techniques are well-compared from a general perspective. However, the background needs to be better written to set the context, missing literature needs to be added, and detailed comparison tables need to be added. Overall, this reviewer recommends a thorough revision of the manuscript before further consideration by Molecules.	{"444, 452, ACTION","534, 540, LOCATION","514, 540, CONTENT","552, 557, ACTION","541, 545, MODAL","401, 408, TRIGGER","503, 508, ACTION","491, 496, MODAL","425, 430, MODAL","401, 408, TRIGGER","452, 470, CONTENT","4, 10, LOCATION","410, 424, CONTENT","472, 490, CONTENT"}

6881	7) The process schemes do not contain process related information and they are simple“copies” from a text book. The authors should provide concrete progress configurations (inc. valves, pumps, flow rates, streams etc.) and discuss the different settings of the system afterwards. Only then the text can be easily followed  and understood.	{"124, 130, MODAL","7, 22, LOCATION","139, 219, CONTENT","223, 230, ACTION","231, 278, CONTENT","124, 131, MODAL","131, 138, ACTION","25, 37, ACTION","37, 65, CONTENT","70, 110, CONTENT","85, 93, LOCATION","305, 321, ACTION","268, 278, TRIGGER"}

6883	9) Style of equations does not meet the scientific standards and they are barely understandable. Moreover, authors should define the number of equations prior to discussing  them, e.g. line 80.	{"122, 178, CONTENT","115, 121, MODAL","12, 21, LOCATION","97, 105, TRIGGER","185, 192, LOCATION","74, 95, ACTION","121, 172, ACTION","185, 192, LOCATION"}

6885	11) The surface modification of membranes, and its versatility, should also be briefly discussed giving  several examples to place the work in a wider context: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es9003697; https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscatal.8b01706; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2017.11.070.	{"160, 304, CONTENT","70, 103, ACTION","97, 103, ACTION","105, 121, CONTENT","64, 70, MODAL","4, 62, CONTENT","87, 96, ACTION"}

6889	The article entitled“Relative validity and reproducibility of a Food Frequency Questionnaire to assess intakes of total and free sugars for use in early childhood dental studies” presents an interesting issue but some corrections are needed. In spite of the fact, that the manuscript presents a valuable study, the presentation is in some aspects quite poor.	{"273, 283, LOCATION","20, 178, LOCATION","218, 240, ACTION","209, 212, TRIGGER","20, 178, LOCATION"}
6890	(1)    It should be specified , if conducted study included only validation of the questionnaire, or it included designing and validation of the questionnaire. The article is presented as if the aim was only validation (it is specified in the Introduction, presented methodology does not include many details associated with the construction of the questionnaire). However, two of the Authors (AB, LD) did not take part in the validation and preparing manuscript, but only in the questionnaire designing. It should be explained  and Authors should correct this inconsistency.	{"508, 515, MODAL","243, 255, LOCATION","10, 16, MODAL","365, 372, TRIGGER","243, 255, LOCATION","19, 29, ACTION","32, 34, TRIGGER","35, 96, CONTENT","98, 100, TRIGGER","101, 158, CONTENT","10, 16, MODAL","20, 29, ACTION","267, 278, LOCATION","279, 295, ACTION","296, 362, CONTENT","365, 373, TRIGGER","518, 527, ACTION","373, 503, CONTENT","548, 555, ACTION","541, 547, MODAL","560, 574, CONTENT"}
6891	(2)    The term“FFQ (Food frequency questionnaire)”, in general does not relate to the specific questionnaire applied by Authors, but it is the type of method. The applied FFQ should be specified , in the whole text (does it have any name/ appellation?). If possible, Authors should use other term (e.g. SMILE-FFQ) to provide for readers the necessary information about what questionnaire was applied.	{"276, 282, MODAL","16, 51, LOCATION","64, 79, ACTION","186, 195, ACTION","282, 286, ACTION","286, 298, CONTENT","130, 133, TRIGGER","176, 182, MODAL","185, 195, ACTION","15, 51, LOCATION","304, 313, CONTENT","217, 252, CONTENT","318, 325, ACTION","342, 400, CONTENT","160, 176, CONTENT","198, 216, LOCATION","176, 182, MODAL"}
6892	(3)    The groups of products included into questionnaire should be specified  (e.g. as a supplementary material), as well as frequencies should be presented . As the readers do not know the applied questionnaire, the presented validation without presenting questionnaire is for readers useless.	{"67, 77, ACTION","90, 103, LOCATION","58, 64, MODAL","90, 112, LOCATION","138, 144, MODAL","126, 137, CONTENT","148, 157, ACTION","6, 58, CONTENT","68, 77, ACTION","58, 64, MODAL"}

6898	(1)    Authors indicated, that the study was conducted in the mother-toddler pairs, but I’m not sure if they really did, as it is not indicated in the Results section. The information, that it was conducted in mother-toddler pairs means, that both mothers and toddlers fulfilled questionnaires. If only mothers did – Authors should indicate, that the study was conducted in a group of mothers of toddlers.	{"151, 166, LOCATION","7, 129, CONTENT","325, 331, MODAL","84, 87, TRIGGER","332, 340, ACTION","295, 325, CONTENT","341, 404, CONTENT","325, 331, MODAL","130, 143, ACTION"}

6918	(3)    The Discussion section in the presented study should include the limitations of the study and limitations of the applied FFQ. Among limitations of the study are e.g. the fact, that participants were entered into the study in various months, that may had changed their diet (due to typical season-related variations of diet) or excluding“child in childcare” days. Among the limitations of the FFQ, especially those associated with the possibility to assess the intake of specific products must be indicated . Taking into account an example indicated in the Materials and methods section, it seems hard to assess the amount of sugar sprinkled on cereal. Other limitation of the questionnaire is the overestimation.	{"11, 29, LOCATION","621, 657, CONTENT","603, 617, ACTION","563, 593, LOCATION","72, 131, CONTENT","59, 67, ACTION","253, 256, MODAL","53, 67, ACTION","11, 21, LOCATION","370, 494, CONTENT","503, 512, ACTION","495, 499, MODAL","343, 363, LOCATION","53, 59, MODAL"}

6923	1) The novelty of the study should be clearly stated  in the abstract, conclusions and the end of the introduction. TNT imprinting as well as the Meisenheimer complexation approach for TNT are both well-studied and there are numerous reports in the literature.

6928	7) The introduction is fairly short and should have a paragraph on imprinted films and their versatile applications such as precious metal recovery (Materials, 2017, 10, 1133), drug delivery (Journal of Biomaterials Science, Polymer Edition 2017, 28, 519-531), ternary mixture separation (React. Funct. Polym., 2015, 86, 215-224), electrodes (J. Mater. Chem. A, 2016, 4, 13989-13996).	{"7, 19, LOCATION","7, 19, LOCATION","52, 384, CONTENT","47, 51, ACTION","40, 46, MODAL","40, 46, MODAL"}

6992	1) The Introduction is weak and does not provide an appropriate context of the research. Applications of magnesium-silicate in water treatment needs to be discussed. Cost efficiency needs to be backed up with some references. Authors should emphasize novelty and significance of their investigation, and clearly mention what the shortcoming of the previously reported approaches are, which would justify the need for the presented work in the manuscript.	{"182, 187, MODAL","143, 148, MODAL","203, 224, CONTENT","7, 19, LOCATION","154, 165, ACTION","89, 142, CONTENT","20, 27, ACTION","32, 48, ACTION","49, 87, CONTENT","325, 382, CONTENT","312, 319, ACTION","194, 203, ACTION","320, 324, TRIGGER","234, 240, MODAL","390, 403, ACTION","7, 19, LOCATION","166, 181, LOCATION","251, 300, CONTENT","320, 324, TRIGGER","241, 250, ACTION","234, 240, MODAL"}

6995	5) The authors should discuss reproducibility of the nanoparticle preparation and the adsorption results. There are no error bars on any graphs. Were there any measurements for independently prepared adsorbents? Robustness of preparation and application should be discussed . The importance of regeneration and careful selection of regeneration method of adsorbents to avoid adsorbent degradation were described in the literature and should be emphasised  in the manuscript (Polymer Chem., 2017, 8, 666-673). What are the specific criteria for the reported nanoparticles?	{"276, 429, CONTENT","253, 260, MODAL","264, 273, ACTION","463, 473, LOCATION","434, 440, MODAL","444, 454, ACTION","474, 507, CONTENT","509, 513, TRIGGER","15, 21, MODAL","15, 29, ACTION","345, 351, LOCATION","509, 571, CONTENT","30, 104, CONTENT","22, 29, ACTION","15, 21, MODAL","145, 149, TRIGGER","150, 210, CONTENT","212, 253, CONTENT"}

7001	11) The trend in water and wastewater treatment is continuously moving towards more sustainable materials and technologies, which should be mentioned  in the introduction (Green Chem. 2015, 17, 5196-5205). The choice of the adsorbent, magnesium silicate, can be considered  as a sustainable and non-harmful source for adsorption, which is a good effort towards sustainable processes. A discussion on the topic should be provided  in the manuscript.	{"129, 136, MODAL","437, 447, LOCATION","158, 170, LOCATION","139, 149, ACTION","130, 136, MODAL","124, 129, TRIGGER","158, 170, LOCATION","4, 124, CONTENT","140, 149, ACTION","172, 203, CONTENT","206, 410, CONTENT","410, 416, MODAL","420, 428, ACTION"}
7002	12) Avoid bulk referencing, on several occasions it is not necessary to use more than one reference, i.e. line 27 [1-3]; line 30 [4-7], line 33 [12, 13]; line 35 [14-17]; line 75 [22, 24]; and line 102 [25-28].	{"55, 68, ACTION","72, 99, CONTENT","171, 187, LOCATION","153, 169, LOCATION","136, 152, LOCATION","4, 9, ACTION","193, 209, LOCATION","106, 119, LOCATION","121, 134, LOCATION","106, 113, LOCATION","10, 26, CONTENT"}
7004	14) Table 4: The results should be presented  with a reasonable number of significant figures, e.g. the adsorption capacity should be rounded  to 275 mg/g.

7008	1. The title is misleading as the focus of the manuscript is on characterisation and application, and not on synthesis.

7011	4.“rapid adsorption 95% of the rhodamine (RhB) within 1 min” statement is meaningless without the experimental conditions.

7013	7. The sustainability of water treatment is an important consideration which should be mentioned  in the introduction and recent examples should be given on the topic: Green Chem., 2015, 17, 5196-5205; Chem.

7016	10. The blocks’ diameter was found to be 10 um (line 99). This needs to be quantified with an imaging software and the average should be given with a standard deviation.

7017	11. The authors claim that the“product becomes relatively thinner”. This statement is vague and experimental evidence is not provided.

The importance of adsorption regeneration should be mentioned and exemplified  (Polym. Chem., 2017, 8, 666-673).

7057	In the presented work, the authors developed a superhydrophobic copper-foam and electrospinning polystyrene fiber for oil-water separation. The article has a potentially interesting premise which could add to the knowledge base of handling and treating  the oily wastewater in the industry. However, the article lacks coherence, appropriate context and experimental design clarification.	{"304, 311, LOCATION","291, 298, TRIGGER","201, 252, ACTION","190, 195, TRIGGER","318, 386, CONTENT","312, 317, ACTION"}

7075	The manuscript by Yang and co-workers details the preparation and application of a composite WO3-UiO-66 catalyst. The work can be considered  as novel with a reasonable potential impact. The conclusions are supported by the data. However, there are several flaws, technical and presentation issues. The context needs to be improved and the background broadened as the introduction is too specific. Consequently, the manuscript needs to be thoroughly revised before further consideration to be published in Nanomaterials.	{"264, 297, CONTENT","449, 457, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION","299, 310, CONTENT","412, 426, LOCATION","129, 140, ACTION","123, 126, MODAL","339, 351, CONTENT","323, 331, ACTION","427, 432, MODAL","230, 237, TRIGGER","381, 396, ACTION","368, 380, LOCATION","230, 237, TRIGGER","256, 262, CONTENT"}

7081	6. The images in Figure 4d-e are too blurred (low resolution) to be able to safely conclude that the size is indeed 3.75 nm and 5.19 nm. The authors should refrain making this statement and making  quantitative evaluations from this data. High-resolution SEM and TEM should be recorded .	{"267, 273, MODAL","149, 155, MODAL","33, 44, ACTION","198, 237, CONTENT","17, 28, LOCATION","171, 185, CONTENT","190, 196, ACTION","17, 26, LOCATION","7, 13, LOCATION","156, 170, ACTION","149, 155, MODAL","155, 196, ACTION","239, 266, CONTENT","277, 285, ACTION"}

7091	16. The experimental work involved undesired chemicals such as DMF, peroxide. The authors should mention that the use of them should be minimised  and in order to increase the sustainability of the synthesis, they should be sustainably recovered  using membranes (ChemSusChem, 2017, 10, 3435–3444).	{"90, 104, ACTION","236, 245, ACTION","247, 297, CONTENT","97, 104, ACTION","110, 125, CONTENT","8, 25, LOCATION","126, 132, MODAL","214, 220, MODAL","151, 208, CONTENT","136, 145, ACTION","90, 96, MODAL","90, 96, MODAL"}

7094	The review is of interest to the MIP community and many important papers are discussed in the review which is in general well-written. However, typos and grammar mistakes are found throughout the review which need to be corrected. Some of them are highlighted in the comments below. Furthermore, some important literature revealing different aspects of MIP-based chiral separation of drugs need to be included as they are currently missing. A deeper, comparative analysis of the processed literature is needed to improve the quality of the review (recommendation are given below).  I recommend major revision of the review.	{"144, 170, CONTENT","101, 106, TRIGGER","503, 509, ACTION","615, 622, LOCATION","401, 409, ACTION","283, 295, TRIGGER","175, 181, ACTION","296, 389, CONTENT","209, 214, MODAL","432, 439, ACTION","441, 499, CONTENT","4, 10, LOCATION","135, 142, TRIGGER","390, 394, MODAL","196, 203, LOCATION","220, 229, ACTION"}

7103	9) The authors should include a comprehensive table where the different MIP-based enantioseparation articles discussed in the review are compared in terms of most importantly enantioselectivity, capacity, MIP formats (microspheres, membranes etc), MIP preparation etc. This is a tedious work but would greatly enhance the quality of the review.	{"51, 57, TRIGGER","32, 51, CONTENT","15, 21, MODAL","21, 29, ACTION","15, 29, ACTION","296, 301, MODAL","52, 57, TRIGGER","57, 268, CONTENT"}
7104	10) Some important works from the field of MIP based separation of chiral drugs are missing. The following articles should be definitely included in the review and the proposed  table (see comment 9): Anal. Chim. Acta 591 (2007) 57-62; J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 37 (2005) 1003-1008; ACS Appl.

7105	11) At some point the authors should group, introduce and discuss the various application (and potential application) fields of enantioseparative MIPs such as detection, drug delivery, downstream processing/pharma purification etc. This grouping should be introduced at the beginning of the review and should be applied in the proposed  comparison table (see comment 9).	{"270, 297, LOCATION","256, 266, ACTION","312, 319, ACTION","231, 245, CONTENT","30, 36, MODAL","30, 42, ACTION","302, 308, MODAL","30, 36, MODAL","246, 252, MODAL","66, 230, CONTENT","36, 65, ACTION","320, 353, LOCATION"}

7107	13) Page 7, line 202: The authors claim that the highest enantioseparation achieved was 16.1 but it is not convincing given that in line 207 an even higher figure is mentioned: 22.3. Preparation of the table mentioned in table 9 will show all the enantioseparation factors and will provide evidence for the authors’ statement which is indeed the highest enantioseparation factor achieved in the literature.	{"4, 10, LOCATION","93, 96, TRIGGER","229, 233, MODAL","229, 238, ACTION","221, 228, LOCATION","4, 10, LOCATION","198, 207, LOCATION","391, 405, LOCATION","132, 140, LOCATION","92, 96, TRIGGER","12, 20, LOCATION","100, 117, ACTION","88, 92, CONTENT","177, 181, CONTENT","118, 128, TRIGGER"}
7108	14) At the end of the review need for future work, main limitations and drawbacks of the field should be clearly mentioned .	{"113, 122, ACTION","29, 33, MODAL","7, 28, LOCATION","72, 94, CONTENT","51, 67, CONTENT","94, 101, MODAL","95, 101, MODAL","104, 122, ACTION"}

7110	The manuscript by Shin and co-workers details the preparation and application of tailored carbon foams. The topic is timely, has some sustainability aspect, and of interest to a broad audience. The work is sufficiently detailed to be reproducible. A good amount of data is presented in the manuscript to support the claims. However, there are several issues that must be addressed  prior to publishing.	{"371, 380, ACTION","363, 367, MODAL","324, 331, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","324, 331, TRIGGER","363, 367, MODAL","370, 380, ACTION","0, 14, LOCATION"}
7111	1. The title is long and therefore difficult to digest; a more succinct title would better assist the readers.	{"58, 77, CONTENT","25, 34, TRIGGER","7, 12, LOCATION","78, 83, MODAL","3, 12, LOCATION","13, 20, ACTION","78, 83, MODAL","84, 97, ACTION","35, 54, ACTION"}
7112	2. What was the rationale for the selection of the 4 materials to be incorporated into the carbon foams? Why Ag, Al, CNT and G were used and compared? Justification should be provided  in the main text.	{"109, 149, CONTENT","69, 81, ACTION","12, 62, CONTENT","105, 108, TRIGGER","174, 183, ACTION","165, 171, MODAL","3, 7, TRIGGER","151, 164, CONTENT","175, 183, ACTION","3, 7, TRIGGER","165, 171, MODAL","188, 201, LOCATION","197, 201, LOCATION","87, 103, LOCATION"}
7113	4. Refrain from exaggeration and vague expressions, e.g.“enormous amounts”	{"56, 74, LOCATION","3, 10, ACTION","56, 74, LOCATION","16, 50, CONTENT"}
7114	5. What do the authors mean by“disagreeable super-cooling problems”? Rephrase as necessary.	{"30, 67, LOCATION","69, 77, ACTION","3, 7, TRIGGER","3, 7, TRIGGER","30, 67, LOCATION"}
7115	6. The grade/purity of all chemicals and solvents should be provided  under the materials section.

7116	7. Line 87-88 needs to be rephrased.	{"14, 19, MODAL","26, 35, ACTION","3, 13, LOCATION","3, 13, CONTENT"}
7117	8. Closely related recent research on erythritol/carbon foam for similar applications should be acknowledged  (Carbon, 2015, 94, 266-276; IOP Materials Science and Engineering, 2017, 182, 012009).	{"86, 92, MODAL","110, 195, CONTENT","86, 92, MODAL","19, 85, CONTENT","95, 108, ACTION","96, 108, ACTION"}
7118	9. Instead of the ambiguous x/y formatting of units, the IUPAC recommended x y^-1 format should be used  throughout the manuscript.	{"28, 51, LOCATION","89, 95, MODAL","75, 88, CONTENT","120, 130, LOCATION","98, 103, ACTION","99, 103, ACTION","89, 95, MODAL","105, 130, LOCATION","3, 13, TRIGGER"}
7119	10. The reproducibility of the Figures 2, 4–5 results should be demonstrated  via including error bars on the plots. Their derivation, e.g. standard deviation, should be discussed  in the text. How many repeats of the same materials were prepared and tested?	{"106, 115, LOCATION","92, 102, CONTENT","54, 60, MODAL","31, 45, LOCATION","202, 257, CONTENT","194, 197, TRIGGER","54, 60, MODAL","63, 76, ACTION","31, 40, LOCATION","117, 158, CONTENT","160, 166, MODAL","64, 76, ACTION","82, 91, ACTION","170, 179, ACTION","184, 192, LOCATION","194, 202, TRIGGER"}
7120	11. The caption for Figure 6 is somewhat confusing. Rephrase it in a more clear way.	{"52, 60, ACTION","61, 63, CONTENT","8, 28, LOCATION","20, 28, LOCATION","40, 50, ACTION"}
7121	12. The presented work relates to the emerging field of sustainable/green solutions. A short introductory paragraph should be added  on the topic with some recent and broad examples to demonstrate the importance and extensive interest in finding sustainable/green solutions (ChemSusChem, 2018, 11, 3640-3648; Green Chem., 2018, 20, 4911-4919; Green Chem., 2017, 19, 3116-3125; Green Chem., 2018, 20, 4901-4910; ACS Catal., 2018, 8, 7430-7438).	{"136, 145, LOCATION","106, 115, LOCATION","201, 443, CONTENT","116, 122, MODAL","185, 196, ACTION","126, 131, ACTION","151, 181, CONTENT","146, 150, TRIGGER","87, 115, CONTENT","125, 131, ACTION","116, 122, MODAL"}
7122	13. The accuracy of the different measurement techniques employed in the study should be reported . In some cases, values are reported down to 0.01 decimal places, which seems inappropriate.	{"4, 65, CONTENT","164, 169, TRIGGER","164, 169, TRIGGER","79, 85, MODAL","88, 97, ACTION","176, 189, ACTION","79, 85, MODAL","89, 97, ACTION","115, 162, CONTENT","69, 78, LOCATION"}
7123	14. The conclusions section should summarize the main research findings, and preferably it should include some quantitative statements. The drawbacks and limitations of the methods should also be mentioned to add a critical edge.	{"91, 105, ACTION","196, 205, ACTION","105, 134, CONTENT","136, 180, CONTENT","181, 187, MODAL","98, 105, ACTION","91, 97, MODAL","4, 27, LOCATION","87, 90, LOCATION","45, 71, CONTENT","35, 44, ACTION","28, 34, MODAL","209, 228, CONTENT","28, 34, MODAL"}
7124	The manuscript entitled“Extract Methods, Molecular Characteristics, and Bioactivities of Polysaccharide from Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) ” presents interesting issue, but it requires some important corrections.	{"168, 171, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","168, 171, TRIGGER","189, 210, CONTENT","23, 139, LOCATION","175, 183, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION"}
7125	1.      Authors did not specify in their manuscript the number of batches and samples. It is hard to guess if the presented study is a“case study” description of only one sample or the material may be perceived  as a representative. Without such information it is hard to conclude about the scientific value of the paper.	{"178, 180, TRIGGER","181, 231, CONTENT","110, 177, CONTENT","107, 109, TRIGGER","93, 106, ACTION","52, 85, CONTENT","16, 31, ACTION","281, 320, CONTENT","264, 280, ACTION","41, 51, LOCATION","41, 51, LOCATION","200, 210, ACTION","194, 197, MODAL"}
7126	2.      For a number of analysis (all except for those presented in sub-chapters 2.5.1. and 2.5.2.) there is no number of repetitions indicated. As a result, it is hard to guess if the result was just random or may be perceived  as a representative. Without such information it is hard to conclude about the scientific value of the paper.	{"178, 180, TRIGGER","67, 98, LOCATION","217, 227, ACTION","181, 207, CONTENT","211, 214, MODAL","38, 44, TRIGGER","100, 111, ACTION","112, 143, CONTENT","158, 177, ACTION","208, 210, TRIGGER","211, 248, CONTENT","250, 274, CONTENT","275, 297, ACTION","298, 337, CONTENT","24, 32, CONTENT"}
7127	Some parts of the manuscript are shabbily prepared (e.g. lacking spaces, or redundant spaces, leadings, References section, etc.)	{"33, 50, ACTION","57, 128, CONTENT","0, 28, LOCATION","18, 28, LOCATION","29, 32, MODAL"}
7128	Authors should avoid personal forms (e.g.“we ascertained”) and they should use rather not personal ones (e.g.“it was ascertained”).	{"41, 57, LOCATION","41, 57, LOCATION","68, 74, MODAL","74, 78, ACTION","21, 35, CONTENT","15, 20, ACTION","86, 103, CONTENT","8, 14, MODAL","8, 20, ACTION","79, 85, TRIGGER","109, 129, CONTENT"}
7129	Authors should briefly justify their study indicating  the background – such information should be added  (one sentence will be enough).	{"55, 69, CONTENT","72, 88, CONTENT","107, 119, CONTENT","120, 124, MODAL","128, 134, ACTION","22, 30, ACTION","111, 119, LOCATION","14, 53, ACTION","8, 14, MODAL","7, 14, MODAL","30, 42, CONTENT","43, 53, ACTION","89, 95, MODAL","99, 104, ACTION"}

7131	The sentences in the second part of the manuscript seem to be not“combined”. In a paragraph each sentence should“follow” the previous one, while in this part they seem as just random information.	{"148, 157, LOCATION","106, 112, MODAL","62, 75, ACTION","121, 137, CONTENT","40, 50, LOCATION","77, 91, LOCATION","113, 119, ACTION","139, 144, TRIGGER","51, 55, MODAL","0, 13, CONTENT","92, 105, CONTENT","21, 50, LOCATION","171, 194, CONTENT","163, 167, MODAL"}
7132	It seems that Authors indicate that extracting procedure may influence structure and, as a result, also the biological activity. Authors should more precisely describe it.	{"168, 170, CONTENT","36, 127, CONTENT","137, 143, MODAL","159, 167, ACTION","57, 60, MODAL"}
7133	In this section, Authors should justify the study, while presenting the history of the problem. In the present form, they present the history of their own past studies. Such justification is in appropriate. If their own studies are the only one that were conducted – it should be described .	{"25, 31, MODAL","51, 56, TRIGGER","3, 15, LOCATION","270, 276, MODAL","25, 31, MODAL","280, 289, ACTION","40, 49, CONTENT","32, 39, ACTION","25, 39, ACTION","191, 205, ACTION","169, 187, CONTENT","207, 209, TRIGGER","210, 264, CONTENT"}

7135	Figure 1 – The photographs do not present any information – they should be removed  from the scheme, as Authors should briefly present most important data with no illustrations.	{"65, 71, MODAL","112, 118, MODAL","42, 58, CONTENT","127, 134, ACTION","0, 8, LOCATION","74, 82, ACTION","30, 41, ACTION","65, 71, MODAL","75, 82, ACTION","0, 8, LOCATION","11, 26, LOCATION","60, 64, CONTENT","93, 99, LOCATION","135, 154, CONTENT","155, 176, ACTION"}
7136	It seems, that Authors did not verify the normality of distribution for the assessed variables. Authors must verify the normality of distribution and specify the test applied for verification.	{"23, 37, ACTION","158, 191, CONTENT","104, 115, ACTION","38, 94, CONTENT","104, 108, MODAL","109, 115, ACTION","115, 145, CONTENT","150, 157, ACTION"}
7137	If the distribution is normal, the mean values should be presented  (accompanied by SD), but if it is different than normal, the median, accompanied by minimum and maximum values should be presented  – it should be specified  that distribution is normal if it is.	{"189, 198, ACTION","179, 185, MODAL","205, 211, MODAL","47, 53, MODAL","69, 86, CONTENT","56, 66, ACTION","215, 224, ACTION","13, 16, TRIGGER","56, 66, ACTION","46, 53, MODAL","0, 2, TRIGGER","3, 29, CONTENT","31, 46, CONTENT","89, 95, TRIGGER","96, 123, CONTENT","125, 178, CONTENT","226, 253, CONTENT","254, 256, TRIGGER","257, 262, CONTENT"}

7143	Discussion: The section should be corrected  accordingly and Authors should objectively assess the value of their results taking  into account the number of batches/ samples/ repetitions.	{"12, 23, LOCATION","95, 121, CONTENT","122, 142, ACTION","143, 186, CONTENT","24, 30, MODAL","88, 94, ACTION","24, 30, MODAL","69, 75, MODAL","0, 10, LOCATION","33, 43, ACTION","34, 43, ACTION"}

7145	Authors should not reproduce results in this section, but they should present the broader conclusion instead (1-3 sentences will be enough).	{"90, 100, LOCATION","63, 77, ACTION","78, 108, CONTENT","70, 77, ACTION","63, 69, MODAL","40, 52, LOCATION","29, 36, CONTENT","54, 57, TRIGGER","15, 28, ACTION","8, 14, MODAL","8, 14, MODAL","124, 128, MODAL","54, 57, TRIGGER","110, 123, CONTENT","132, 138, ACTION"}
7146	Authors should correct this section in order to indicate clearly which Author contributed. E.g. who is“GZ”? do Authors mean GGZ?

7148	1.      The main value of the study would be properly conducted  validation of the CSSQP, but in practice, Authors presented no results of the validation. The properly conducted validation procedure requires to assess the results of both validity of the questionnaire (in comparison with other tool) and reproducibility of the tool (while it is applied at least twice), while Authors conduct none of them. The“validation” that Authors presented (that is not the validation of the questionnaire, in spite of the fact, that Authors called it so) is rather some descriptive statistics of obtained results, but with no comparison with other method and with no test-retest trial.	{"44, 63, ACTION","612, 625, ACTION","90, 93, TRIGGER","8, 35, CONTENT","626, 674, CONTENT","54, 63, ACTION","64, 88, CONTENT","155, 198, CONTENT","199, 207, ACTION","409, 421, LOCATION","36, 41, MODAL","603, 606, TRIGGER","409, 421, LOCATION","36, 41, MODAL","370, 375, TRIGGER","139, 153, CONTENT","90, 93, TRIGGER","547, 553, TRIGGER","384, 396, ACTION","304, 368, CONTENT","219, 299, CONTENT","300, 303, TRIGGER","208, 217, ACTION","115, 138, ACTION"}
7149	In order to correct the study, Authors should conduct some further analysis – they should in their group of respondents try to collect once again the same CSSQP forms (in order to assess reproducibility) and any other forms commonly applied to assess the colonoscopy satisfaction (in order to assess validity). There is a number of such possibilities, as a number of very simple tools is already used in practice to assess the colonoscopy satisfaction.	{"208, 280, CONTENT","293, 308, ACTION","180, 202, ACTION","150, 166, CONTENT","127, 134, ACTION","204, 207, TRIGGER","39, 45, MODAL","46, 53, ACTION","53, 76, CONTENT","83, 89, MODAL","39, 45, MODAL"}

[2009] entitled“Patient satisfaction with colonoscopy: A literature review and pilot study” (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2694655/). The indicated study is very important in the field (but not referred by Authors in the presented manuscript) as it presents a number of possibilities of assessing the colonoscopy satisfaction (1-question tools, e.g. 5-point and 7-point Likert scale, visual analogue scale, the satisfaction/ preference assessment, with the questions such as“How satisfied were you with the procedure overall?”,“If it were advised by your doctor, how willing would you be to undergo this test again?”).	{"76, 152, LOCATION","8, 14, MODAL","15, 22, ACTION","262, 265, TRIGGER","23, 209, CONTENT","8, 14, MODAL","293, 317, LOCATION","262, 265, TRIGGER","266, 278, ACTION"}
7151	If Authors do not want to use, as a reference method, the indicated instruments that are dedicated for the colonoscopy satisfaction assessment, they may use as a reference method some general medical patient satisfaction questionnaires, as there is also a number of such questionnaires. But they must have any reference method for validation procedure.	{"157, 285, CONTENT","153, 156, ACTION","149, 152, MODAL","287, 290, TRIGGER","287, 290, TRIGGER","296, 300, MODAL","149, 156, ACTION","46, 52, LOCATION","296, 300, MODAL","301, 305, ACTION","306, 352, CONTENT"}

7185	In this manuscript, Wang and co-workers describe the synthesis, characterisation and application of magnetic NPs for environmental clean-up. An excessive amount of experimental data were collected and presented in the manuscript. The research topic is timely and globally important, and contributes to the efforts toward sustainabile separations. The work is novel and of interest to the broad readership of Nanomaterials. However, the article has several technical and presentation issues. Furthermore, setting the context and background for the research must be improved and broadened . Consequently, major revision is recommended to address the points below prior to further consideration for publishing in Nanomaterials.	{"3, 18, LOCATION","603, 617, CONTENT","444, 489, CONTENT","636, 723, CONTENT","621, 632, ACTION","589, 601, TRIGGER","577, 586, ACTION","564, 572, ACTION","556, 560, MODAL","528, 538, LOCATION","504, 511, ACTION","511, 523, LOCATION","491, 502, TRIGGER","432, 443, LOCATION","423, 430, TRIGGER","8, 18, LOCATION","563, 586, ACTION","556, 560, MODAL","423, 430, TRIGGER"}

7189	4. The authors should discuss the reproducibility of the preparation of the NPs as well as the adsorption experiments. Error bars / standard deviations should be presented when possible. Section 3.6 is useful but solutions to avoid the decreasing performance should be made based  on the literature. Could a carefully selected regeneration method avoid this problem?	{"118, 151, CONTENT","300, 305, MODAL","318, 326, ACTION","172, 176, TRIGGER","268, 273, ACTION","15, 21, MODAL","15, 29, ACTION","187, 198, LOCATION","259, 265, MODAL","213, 258, CONTENT","209, 212, TRIGGER","202, 208, ACTION","187, 198, LOCATION","326, 365, CONTENT","162, 171, ACTION","152, 158, MODAL","30, 118, CONTENT","22, 30, ACTION","15, 21, MODAL"}

7191	6. The authors mention that magnetic NPs are green but did not elaborate on it. Given the global trend toward sustainable solutions, the greenness/sustainability of the presented methodology should be emphasized . Examples for sustainable adsorption including materials and process perspectives should be given in the introduction: Green Chem., 2017, 19, 3116-3125; Waste Management, 2011, 31, 1350-1356; Green Chem., 2015, 17, 5196-5205.	{"332, 438, CONTENT","51, 54, TRIGGER","295, 301, MODAL","191, 197, MODAL","51, 54, TRIGGER","201, 211, ACTION","314, 330, LOCATION","80, 190, CONTENT","214, 294, CONTENT","200, 211, ACTION","318, 330, LOCATION","305, 310, ACTION","191, 197, MODAL","59, 72, ACTION","76, 78, CONTENT","28, 50, CONTENT"}

7194	9. The novelty of the work should be clearly stated  at the beginning of the manuscript. Applying aqueous media instead of organic solvents comes across as the main point. However, there are some literature reporting NPs synthesized in water. These should be mentioned and the current work should be compared  to them.	{"181, 241, CONTENT","77, 87, LOCATION","27, 33, MODAL","172, 179, TRIGGER","300, 309, ACTION","290, 296, MODAL","273, 289, CONTENT","259, 268, ACTION","249, 255, MODAL","172, 179, TRIGGER","123, 170, CONTENT","112, 122, ACTION","89, 111, CONTENT","53, 87, LOCATION","45, 51, ACTION","27, 33, MODAL","3, 26, CONTENT","36, 51, ACTION"}
7195	10. In line 63 the argument against organic solvents is finished. At the end of this paragraph, the authors should mention that if the organic solvent cannot be avoided  then they should be recycled /recovered to improve the sustainability (although they add to the complexity of the process), and give broad examples for sustainable recovery processes from the literature: Desalination, 2003, 157, 87-95; ChemSusChem, 2017, 10, 3435-3444; J.

7196	11. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms were performed at relatively high concentrations. What is the actual concentration of Mercury in the environment and how does that relate to the tested concentrations?

7200	The fact, that Authors conducted any study associated with vitamin D does not mean, that it should be included into the review associated  with the role of this nutrient in fertility/ pregnancy/ lactation. As the own studies of Authors can not be found in Pubmed while using the indicated  keywords (including: fertility, pregnancy, lactation, breastfeeding, breast milk), they should not be included  into the review about it.	{"92, 98, MODAL","391, 400, ACTION","378, 384, MODAL","116, 126, LOCATION","102, 110, ACTION","92, 98, MODAL","145, 205, CONTENT","101, 137, ACTION","205, 371, CONTENT","407, 417, LOCATION","23, 82, CONTENT"}
7202	Authors should present the number of publications that were found using  the indicated keywords, number of excluded ones (with the specified reasons of exclusion), number of additional references included on the basis of the analysis of the references of found studies (but only if associated with the aim of the study!), etc. The flowchart is recommended to obtain the better clarity.	{"270, 273, TRIGGER","8, 14, MODAL","14, 22, ACTION","22, 326, CONTENT","327, 340, LOCATION","344, 355, ACTION","359, 384, CONTENT","14, 71, ACTION"}
7203	Moreover, the other important issue is associated with the fact, that Author Contributions seems controversial and indicate the potential Guest Authorship procedure, which is forbidden. While there are 10 co-authors of the manuscript, in fact only one of them prepared the manuscript. SP was responsible for (1) conceptualization, (2) methodology, (3) data curation (by the way – what“data curation”, if there was no specific data gathered and only a review was prepared?), and (4) writing an original manuscript. The rest of Authors (9 of them!) edited the prepared manuscript and supervised SP. If they not participated in the manuscript preparation, they should be not indicated  as authors, but SP may thank them in the Acknowledgements Section, if needed. If they really participated, their role should be specified .	{"91, 96, ACTION","96, 110, CONTENT","115, 123, ACTION","123, 164, CONTENT","667, 681, ACTION","223, 233, LOCATION","186, 191, TRIGGER","202, 215, CONTENT","218, 233, LOCATION","243, 259, CONTENT","260, 268, ACTION","268, 284, LOCATION","285, 287, LOCATION","292, 303, ACTION","308, 513, CONTENT","514, 546, CONTENT","547, 553, ACTION","582, 592, ACTION","593, 595, LOCATION","668, 681, ACTION","658, 664, MODAL","682, 693, CONTENT","699, 701, LOCATION","702, 706, MODAL","706, 711, ACTION","720, 748, CONTENT","801, 807, MODAL","811, 820, ACTION","553, 577, LOCATION","658, 664, MODAL","166, 171, TRIGGER","70, 90, LOCATION","763, 788, CONTENT","750, 752, TRIGGER","0, 8, TRIGGER","166, 171, TRIGGER","174, 184, ACTION","597, 599, TRIGGER","600, 651, CONTENT","761, 763, TRIGGER","753, 759, ACTION","790, 800, CONTENT"}
7204	The manuscript describes the synthesis and adsorption performance of Bisphenol A and progesterone selective imprinted polymers. The parameters of polymer preparation were designed and studied using Design of Experiment and MODDE software. The produced molecularly imprinted polymers were studied regarding the adsorption capacity, isotherms and kinetics. The original aim of the article is interesting and relevant, however there are mistakes and inconsistencies throughout the manuscript that must be addressed  prior to further consideration for publishing.	{"0, 14, LOCATION","474, 488, LOCATION","424, 462, CONTENT","416, 423, TRIGGER","494, 498, MODAL","501, 511, ACTION","494, 498, MODAL","416, 423, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","502, 511, ACTION"}
7205	1) The authors set their aim in the last paragraph of the Introduction as the followings:“to unify the procedure of the synthesis of MIPs by the optimisation of different parameters during the polymerisation” and“to contribute to the detection and separation of different compounds from complex samples”. However, it is not clear how these goals was realized.	{"54, 70, LOCATION","32, 50, LOCATION","320, 329, ACTION","89, 303, LOCATION","305, 312, TRIGGER","41, 50, LOCATION","330, 358, CONTENT","305, 312, TRIGGER"}
7206	2) The application of the produced MIPs for the detection of trace amount of EDs from real samples should be performed to prove their applicability in the proposed  field.	{"128, 147, CONTENT","3, 98, CONTENT","109, 118, ACTION","99, 105, MODAL","122, 127, ACTION","108, 163, ACTION","98, 105, MODAL"}
7208	4) The authors should briefly discuss the literature on the application of Modde/DoE in analytical chemistry with examples: Drug Test. Anal., 2014, 6, 898-908; Metabolomics, 2016, 12, 183; J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal., 2012, 70, 251-258).	{"15, 21, MODAL","30, 37, ACTION","15, 21, MODAL","38, 233, CONTENT"}

7217	7) The retention capacity has little meaning in itself it can be only interpreted  knowing the experimental conditions. The MIP loading and the original concentration should be indicated when retention capacities are presented . E.g.: Line 25 Introduction, Figure 4 caption and Figure 5 caption.	{"120, 166, CONTENT","64, 81, ACTION","58, 61, MODAL","187, 191, TRIGGER","278, 294, LOCATION","257, 273, LOCATION","243, 255, LOCATION","235, 242, LOCATION","177, 186, ACTION","167, 173, MODAL","235, 242, LOCATION","187, 191, TRIGGER","192, 226, CONTENT"}
7218	8) The first two paragraphs of the introduction describe the health effects of endocrine disruptors in details. This part is unnecessarily extensive for a manuscript in analytical and polymer science. This should be shortened  down to 4-5 sentences and 2-3 references.	{"235, 267, CONTENT","216, 231, ACTION","3, 27, LOCATION","31, 47, LOCATION","206, 212, MODAL","206, 212, MODAL","215, 225, ACTION","35, 47, LOCATION"}

7220	10) Calibration curves were obtained in a narrow concentration region (1-5 mg/L for BPA and 0.88 and 8.8 mg/L for PG). However, in the adsorption isotherm studies significantly higher concentrations were used (25-200 mg/L). How were these concentrations determined?	{"223, 227, TRIGGER","119, 126, TRIGGER","233, 253, CONTENT","254, 264, ACTION","4, 22, LOCATION","119, 126, TRIGGER"}

7223	13) The authors demonstrated reproducibility to a certain degree in the manuscript. As recently shown, the importance of careful selection of the eluent for imprinted polymers should be discussed  along with the results (Polym. Chem., 2017, 8, 666-673). It also needs to be clarified whether the“triplicate” data presented are based on independently prepared polymers, or using the same polymers three times.	{"208, 219, LOCATION","295, 307, LOCATION","72, 82, LOCATION","185, 195, ACTION","220, 252, CONTENT","262, 267, MODAL","308, 407, CONTENT","186, 195, ACTION","176, 182, MODAL","103, 175, CONTENT","274, 283, ACTION","176, 182, MODAL"}

7227	The manuscript by Yin and co-workers provides insights into the preparation and properties of keratin-based membranes. The work is novel and a reasonable amount of reliable data is presented. The topic is of interest to both polymer chemists and materials scientists working in the field of bio-derived polymers and membranes. Nonetheless, there are several issues with the manuscript that must be thoroughly addressed  prior to further consideration for publishing in Polymers.	{"409, 418, ACTION","390, 394, MODAL","390, 394, MODAL","397, 418, ACTION","327, 338, TRIGGER","350, 364, CONTENT","4, 14, LOCATION","370, 384, LOCATION","0, 14, LOCATION"}

7230	3. Waste feather, and the recovery of keratin from it, are introduced in the 1st paragraph of the introduction. In line 40 the authors should mention that the recovery of valuable chemicals from waste is a highly sought-after sustainable approach, and give recent examples: Green Chem. 2017, 19, 3116-3125; J. Environ. Chem. Eng. 2017, 5, 3051-3057.	{"94, 110, LOCATION","81, 90, LOCATION","115, 122, LOCATION","135, 141, MODAL","142, 149, ACTION","73, 90, LOCATION","155, 349, CONTENT","135, 149, ACTION"}

7235	8. A short paragraph should be provided on a potential application of crosslinked  polymer membranes. Crosslinking is often used to fabricate solvent-resistant membranes for nanofiltration (ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 2018, 10, 16140-16147; J. Membr.

7244	In this manuscript, Gao and co-workers describe the preparation, characterisation and performance of bone char. A reasonable amount of experimental data were collected and presented in the manuscript. The research topic is timely and globally important. The work is novel and of interest to the broad readership of the journal. However, the article has several issues regarding the presentation of data, missing experiments, and setting the context and background for the research. The latter is currently limited and must be broadened  as per the comments below. Consequently, major revision is recommended to address the points below prior to further consideration for publishing in Applied Sciences.	{"619, 635, CONTENT","611, 618, ACTION","564, 577, TRIGGER","327, 335, TRIGGER","8, 18, LOCATION","353, 481, CONTENT","482, 492, LOCATION","3, 18, LOCATION","578, 592, CONTENT","595, 607, ACTION","328, 335, TRIGGER","518, 522, MODAL","525, 535, ACTION","540, 562, CONTENT","525, 535, ACTION","518, 522, MODAL","506, 513, ACTION","337, 348, LOCATION"}
7245	1. What do the authors mean by“bone char size has a weak effect”? In any case, the conclusions should not be discussed  in the abstract.	{"79, 94, LOCATION","95, 101, MODAL","108, 118, ACTION","30, 64, LOCATION","3, 7, TRIGGER","30, 64, LOCATION","3, 7, TRIGGER","95, 105, MODAL","109, 118, ACTION","123, 135, LOCATION"}
7246	2. The authors should comment on the reproducibility of their methods and results. Were independently prepared bone char samples used for the adsorption experiments? Standard deviations as error bars should be given on the graphs presenting  the adsorption and reusability data. The text and the figure captions should explicitly mention how these errors were derived.	{"166, 199, CONTENT","15, 21, MODAL","22, 29, ACTION","33, 81, CONTENT","219, 229, LOCATION","229, 277, CONTENT","279, 287, LOCATION","312, 318, MODAL","330, 337, ACTION","87, 128, CONTENT","129, 133, ACTION","342, 367, CONTENT","200, 206, MODAL","138, 164, CONTENT","338, 341, TRIGGER","15, 21, MODAL","206, 240, ACTION","283, 287, LOCATION","210, 215, ACTION","292, 311, LOCATION","83, 87, TRIGGER"}

7248	4. As mentioned in line 43, bone char is a green/sustainable adsorbent. Given the importance and desired trend toward sustainable solutions, the authors should add a subsequent short paragraph on sustainable adsorption including  adsorbent and process focused examples: Green Chem., 2017, 19, 3116-3125; Waste Management, 2011, 31, 1350-1356.	{"160, 163, ACTION","164, 342, CONTENT","28, 70, CONTENT","19, 26, LOCATION","6, 15, ACTION","19, 26, LOCATION","159, 228, ACTION","153, 159, MODAL"}
7249	5. The molecular dimensions of MB is given on Figure 2b. However, there is neither quantum chemical calculation presented in the manuscript to derive these values, nor reference to support it. These dimensions also depend on the solvent. Are these values calculated in gas phase or water? The details for the calculations should be given, if not done then omit the values from the figure.	{"242, 254, CONTENT","255, 265, ACTION","112, 121, ACTION","83, 111, CONTENT","289, 321, CONTENT","57, 64, TRIGGER","46, 55, LOCATION","322, 328, MODAL","331, 337, ACTION","356, 360, ACTION","361, 371, CONTENT","377, 387, LOCATION","46, 55, LOCATION","322, 328, MODAL","57, 64, TRIGGER","167, 177, CONTENT","125, 139, LOCATION","181, 188, ACTION","351, 355, TRIGGER","238, 241, TRIGGER","342, 350, CONTENT","339, 341, TRIGGER","265, 287, CONTENT","164, 167, TRIGGER"}

7251	7. The authors mention that the nanoparticles are difficult to recover (line 36). Possible sustainable solutions for the recycle/recovery of these photocatalysts should be mentioned  in a subsequent sentence, and broad examples for sustainable recovery processes from the literature should be mentioned : ACS Catal., 2018, 8, 7430-7438; ChemSusChem, 2017, 10, 3435-3444.	{"72, 79, LOCATION","162, 168, MODAL","171, 181, ACTION","293, 302, ACTION","72, 79, LOCATION","283, 289, MODAL","162, 168, MODAL","188, 207, LOCATION","82, 161, CONTENT","172, 181, ACTION","213, 282, CONTENT","305, 369, CONTENT","209, 212, TRIGGER"}
7252	8. The kinetic and isotherm models seem to be randomly selected. What were the rationale behind their selection? There are various models in the literature, and usually all of them are probed until the best fit is found. Justify your choice, or include further analysis.	{"229, 240, CONTENT","221, 228, ACTION","75, 111, CONTENT","65, 69, TRIGGER","253, 269, CONTENT","245, 252, ACTION","65, 69, TRIGGER"}
7253	9. The scale bar is duplicated in Figure 1b. Delete the additional large scale bar. Moreover, the caption of Figure 2b says SEM and then there is a reference, which should be deleted as I assume the SEM presented is taken by the authors and it is not reprinted  from the literature. Same comment goes for Ref 11 in line 148.	{"94, 105, LOCATION","165, 171, MODAL","174, 260, ACTION","159, 164, TRIGGER","283, 295, CONTENT","124, 157, CONTENT","165, 171, MODAL","84, 92, TRIGGER","34, 43, LOCATION","3, 16, LOCATION","20, 30, ACTION","34, 43, LOCATION","45, 51, ACTION","52, 82, CONTENT","304, 311, LOCATION","84, 92, TRIGGER","315, 323, LOCATION","175, 182, ACTION","109, 118, LOCATION","296, 300, ACTION"}

7256	12. At the end of the results and discussion section, the authors should mention that the bone char’s performance could be fine-tuned with various treatments, and give some examples where materials’ performance were tailored using treatment techniques such as solvent treatment and pyrolysis treatment (Adsorption Science & Technology, 2016, 34, 368-387; ACS Appl.

7296	The manuscript entitled“EU regulation on the use of antioxidants in meat preparation and in meat products” presents interesting issue, but before being published it requires a really major corrections.	{"164, 173, ACTION","174, 200, CONTENT","135, 138, TRIGGER","0, 14, LOCATION","23, 106, LOCATION","135, 138, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION"}
7297	In general, scientific publication has some requirements and without them, the manuscript should not be published . Authors corrected some issues, but only some of them and a lot of work should still be done.	{"147, 150, TRIGGER","103, 113, ACTION","75, 89, LOCATION","89, 100, MODAL","104, 113, ACTION","11, 73, CONTENT","151, 186, CONTENT","186, 193, MODAL","200, 207, ACTION","79, 89, LOCATION","90, 96, MODAL","147, 150, TRIGGER"}
7298	1.      In their manuscript, Authors presented mainly digest from some EU regulations, with no practical presentation of commonly applied possibilities.

7302	4.      Authors can not be so focused  on Italian case as in their title there is EU regulation, not EU regulation in Italy.	{"16, 19, MODAL","26, 37, ACTION","16, 23, MODAL","38, 124, CONTENT","67, 72, LOCATION","30, 37, ACTION"}
7303	5.      Taking into account, that the Materials and methods section is not presented (it should be added  and is essential for reviews), without any specific information, it is hard to understand which studies were included into review and why. Authors did not present any key words, which were used during literature search, inclusion and exclusion criteria of references, information about the procedure of literature search conducted by them, number of chosen references, as well as information if some of them were excluded from the review and on the basis of which criteria (all the indicated information should be presented ).	{"89, 95, MODAL","38, 67, LOCATION","98, 104, ACTION","89, 95, MODAL","99, 104, ACTION","610, 616, MODAL","620, 629, ACTION","269, 578, CONTENT","196, 201, TRIGGER"}
7304	6.      In spite of specified title, Authors included a number of information that are not associated with the aim of the study (e.g. chapter 5 entitled“Factors which influence the growth and survival of micro-organisms in food”), so their narrative review is neither comprehensive nor brief.	{"152, 228, LOCATION","8, 19, TRIGGER","161, 166, TRIGGER","30, 35, LOCATION","30, 35, LOCATION","134, 143, LOCATION"}
7305	7.      Authors presented some really basic and trivial information that should not be included to the article published  specifically in the“Foods” journal – e.g.“food of animal origin contains sufficient water for all micro-organisms to develop”	{"163, 247, LOCATION","7, 67, CONTENT","73, 79, MODAL","73, 83, MODAL","141, 148, LOCATION","87, 95, ACTION","99, 110, LOCATION","86, 120, ACTION"}
7306	8.      In the case of the scientific manuscript, Authors should present the graphical material only if it is needed and it presents some information for readers. It is not a column of a newspaper and illustrations presenting photograph of hamburger and dry salami are unnecessary. Especially in the case of a review article, when Authors did not analyse the specific products, the question arises why Authors decided to present the specific products.	{"38, 48, LOCATION","124, 132, ACTION","133, 161, CONTENT","58, 72, ACTION","326, 330, TRIGGER","58, 64, MODAL","64, 72, ACTION","73, 116, CONTENT","398, 401, TRIGGER","420, 428, ACTION","429, 450, CONTENT"}
7307	9.      Moreover, the academic language is needed. Authors applied not scientific language, with a number of colloquial phrases (e.g.“germ does not tolerate this passage”)	{"8, 16, TRIGGER","133, 170, LOCATION","18, 39, CONTENT","43, 49, ACTION","133, 170, LOCATION"}

7309	The manuscript by Vuppala and Stoller describes the preparation and use of a photocatalyst in the olive industry. The results are new and the topic fits well in the scope of the journal.

7315	6, Extraction processes in olive industry are continuously improving, including phenolic compounds extraction, and all aspects from waste treatment to valorization. The authors should demonstrate this by mentioning  diverse examples to give a better context in the introduction (10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.04.096; 10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b04245; 10.1039/C7GC00912G; 10.1016/j.dib.2016.05.076).	{"216, 389, CONTENT","265, 277, LOCATION","184, 195, ACTION","204, 214, ACTION","177, 183, MODAL","183, 214, ACTION"}

7326	1.    Authors must balance the presented information, taking into account not only the nutritional value (mineral content) of seaweeds, but also the general intake of minerals observed for a population. It is especially important in the case of Na, as the general intake in both developing and developed countries (for America, Europe and Asia) is higher than the recommended level. As a result, Authors can not indicate that seaweeds are valuable in human nutrition, inter alia due to Na content, as it is not a value, but the main weakness of including seaweeds to diet. This approach is presented by Authors in many parts of the study and it should be in the whole study corrected .	{"573, 586, CONTENT","658, 673, LOCATION","19, 26, ACTION","136, 139, TRIGGER","14, 18, MODAL","14, 18, MODAL","654, 683, ACTION","614, 637, LOCATION","674, 683, ACTION","645, 651, MODAL","404, 411, MODAL","26, 52, CONTENT","411, 420, ACTION","54, 134, CONTENT","136, 139, TRIGGER","139, 201, CONTENT","426, 466, CONTENT","520, 523, TRIGGER","523, 572, CONTENT"}
7327	Especially for the supposition, that seaweeds may be a good salt replacers, enabling the reduced use of NaCl, to balance Na/K ratio (chapter 4.1-4.2), Authors must take into account the contribution of algae to RDA. As the presented algae (table 2) contribute to the 8-34% RDA value for Na but only 1-23% RDA value for K (while 9 algae in table 2 are characterized by the higher contribution of Na and only 3 – by higher contribution of K), they does not balance Na/K ratio. In the general western diet, there is too much Na, but not enough K, so adding more Na and less K does not balance the ratio but the influence on the ratio is negative.	{"240, 247, LOCATION","599, 603, TRIGGER","159, 163, MODAL","168, 214, CONTENT","186, 198, LOCATION","339, 346, LOCATION","46, 49, MODAL","192, 195, TRIGGER","164, 168, ACTION","133, 148, LOCATION"}

7337	6) The author mentions the advantages of biofilters over conventional H2S removal technologies. It should be explicitly mentioned  that biofilters provide a more sustainable wastewater treatment solution than the conventional techniques. The increasing demand and trend for sustainable wastewater treatment should be exemplified  in the discussion: Green Chem. 2015, 17, 5196-5205; Energy Environ.

7399	Authors should precisely present the obtained results, in order to be in agreement with what was in fact studied. Some sentences are misleading – e.g. “Induction of UC in rats increased TNF-α, IL-6, ESR, and MPO levels” suggests that Authors compared baseline results (before experiment) with the results after the study, while in fact they compared various groups after the study, so the sentence should be formulated  as “after the experiment, group X was characterized by higher NF-α, IL-6, ESR, and MPO levels, than group Y”. Such problems should be corrected  in whole study. Authors should discuss the obtained results while referring  the relevant publications conducted in a UC patients – if Authors specify spirulina as a source of carotenoids, including zeaxanthine, they should refer such studies which indicate the effect of zeaxanthine in UC (there are a number of such studies) Authors should use the vocabulary applied in nutritional sciences – e.g. There is no such category of food products as “healthy food” – I suppose that Authors may mean functional foods – do they? Authors should use more scientific language – it should be corrected  in the whole manuscript (e.g. “Inflammatory bowel disease (…) lacks a definitive cure”, “Inflammatory bowel disease (…) is characterised by (…) poor prognosis” – more specific information are needed). Such problems should be corrected  in whole study.	{"88, 92, TRIGGER","397, 404, MODAL","408, 418, ACTION","8, 14, MODAL","422, 528, CONTENT","389, 397, LOCATION","530, 543, CONTENT","543, 550, MODAL","554, 563, ACTION","589, 595, MODAL","596, 603, ACTION","696, 699, TRIGGER","708, 715, ACTION","715, 775, CONTENT","1055, 1059, ACTION","1051, 1054, MODAL","782, 788, MODAL","642, 694, CONTENT","631, 640, ACTION","788, 794, ACTION","795, 807, CONTENT","807, 813, TRIGGER","813, 823, ACTION","33, 53, CONTENT","827, 891, CONTENT","900, 906, MODAL","907, 910, ACTION","915, 957, CONTENT","1011, 1025, LOCATION","1060, 1076, CONTENT","1096, 1103, MODAL","1103, 1106, ACTION","1136, 1144, MODAL","1147, 1156, ACTION","1188, 1244, LOCATION","1246, 1317, LOCATION","1319, 1345, CONTENT","1350, 1356, ACTION","1359, 1372, CONTENT","1373, 1379, MODAL","151, 219, LOCATION","1382, 1392, ACTION","1397, 1408, LOCATION","119, 127, LOCATION","407, 418, ACTION","8, 14, MODAL","25, 32, ACTION","604, 624, CONTENT","1165, 1181, LOCATION","1107, 1131, CONTENT","322, 327, TRIGGER"}

7437	10. The introductory discussions about the membrane–solute/particle interactions should mention the polymer memory effect as previously used solvents can alter the performance of membranes, which can also be exploited to achieve the desired separation performance (DOI: 10.1021/acsami.7b01879). Such approach should be mentioned as it has a potential to further improve the microfiltration membrane in the presented  study.	{"309, 315, MODAL","96, 189, CONTENT","319, 328, ACTION","88, 95, ACTION","208, 217, ACTION","81, 95, ACTION","190, 195, TRIGGER","190, 195, TRIGGER","150, 153, MODAL","295, 308, CONTENT","81, 87, MODAL","196, 199, MODAL","218, 293, CONTENT","4, 80, CONTENT"}

7452	11) In the Abstract, the authors mentioned“specificity” for CA adsorption, however, although one reference ([46]) is given, no other molecule adsorption experiments were done and compared with CA. The authors should consider selecting and comparing  a few other molecules to support the argument. Or delete“specificity” from the Abstract, which, however, will compromise the level of the research.	{"355, 359, MODAL","215, 248, ACTION","300, 306, ACTION","329, 337, LOCATION","250, 295, CONTENT","75, 82, TRIGGER","75, 82, TRIGGER","209, 215, MODAL","11, 19, LOCATION","11, 19, LOCATION","346, 353, TRIGGER","42, 55, LOCATION","108, 112, LOCATION","297, 299, TRIGGER","239, 248, ACTION","306, 319, LOCATION","225, 234, ACTION","60, 73, CONTENT","355, 396, CONTENT"}

7463	2. It should be made clear to the non-specialized audience what AB and ABA surfactants are (include block copolymer). These abbreviations are used without explanation in the abstract. All abbreviations should be spelled out the first time they are used , e.g. PPC, CMC and AIBN.	{"59, 63, TRIGGER","184, 201, CONTENT","174, 182, LOCATION","64, 116, CONTENT","174, 182, LOCATION","211, 252, ACTION","6, 12, MODAL","59, 63, TRIGGER","16, 26, ACTION","6, 12, MODAL","202, 208, MODAL","212, 223, ACTION","224, 277, CONTENT"}

7467	6. In the second paragraph of the introduction the authors discuss the degradation/depolymerization studies of polymers. The discussion should mention Polym. Chem., 2017, 8, 666-673 done on long-term reversible and irreversible degradation/hydrolysis of polymers under acidic and basic conditions. Can the hydrolysis shown in Figure 2 be reversible under certain conditions?	{"298, 301, TRIGGER","17, 26, LOCATION","10, 46, LOCATION","151, 296, CONTENT","298, 301, MODAL","121, 135, CONTENT","136, 150, ACTION","136, 142, MODAL","142, 150, ACTION","325, 334, LOCATION","302, 316, CONTENT","335, 373, CONTENT"}
7468	7. The authors claim solvent-free procedure but it seems from the descriptions that MeCN, water and diethyl ether were used during the procedure. The‘solvent-free’ comment should be removed .	{"44, 47, TRIGGER","172, 178, MODAL","182, 189, ACTION","181, 189, ACTION","149, 171, CONTENT","149, 163, LOCATION","172, 178, MODAL"}

7480	The main problem is associated with the fact, that the validation procedure requires the specific method of statistical analysis, that was not applied in the presented study. Preferably, Authors should apply either Bland-Altman plot or kappa statistics.

7481	It seems that Authors are not native English speakers, as some sentences are hard to follow – I think that the article should be corrected  by a fluent English speaker (e.g. instead of“the study was taken to extract banana juice”, there should be“The aim of the study was to analyse the process of banana juice extraction”, etc.).	{"184, 229, LOCATION","119, 125, MODAL","246, 322, CONTENT","237, 243, MODAL","128, 138, ACTION","58, 91, CONTENT","119, 125, MODAL","129, 138, ACTION","184, 229, LOCATION","174, 184, TRIGGER"}

7500	Authors presented excessive figures but with weak explanation why such model was applied – in my opinion, they should rather present a lower number of them, but they must justify the model and describe the obtained results in the context of the future application of observed data.	{"111, 117, MODAL","179, 188, CONTENT","171, 178, ACTION","156, 161, TRIGGER","135, 155, CONTENT","125, 132, ACTION","111, 117, MODAL","28, 35, LOCATION","166, 178, ACTION","36, 39, TRIGGER","193, 201, ACTION","201, 281, CONTENT","28, 35, LOCATION","166, 170, MODAL","35, 39, TRIGGER"}

7502	The limitations section is necessary – Authors should include the limitations section as a separate paragraph in the Discussion section and present the limitations of their study, associated both with the conducted experiment (e.g. number of batches, repetitions), and with concluding (e.g. were there any interrupting factors, that may have influenced the observed results?).	{"53, 61, ACTION","47, 53, MODAL","24, 36, ACTION","0, 23, CONTENT","148, 376, CONTENT","140, 148, ACTION","100, 109, LOCATION","333, 336, MODAL","62, 109, CONTENT","47, 61, ACTION","117, 135, LOCATION"}
7503	In the submitted manuscript, the authors studied the adsorptive properties of poly(1-methylpyrrol-2-ylsquaraine) (PMPS) particles for the separation of endocrine disrupting chemicals EDCs from aqueous solution in batch and fixed column configurations. The topic is important and timely. The experimental adsorption data were discussed and compared to the data reported in literature for activated carbon adsorbent. However, the novelty is unclear, and there are several issues that needs to be addressed prior to further consideration to be published in Processes.	{"17, 27, LOCATION","17, 27, LOCATION","415, 422, TRIGGER","494, 503, ACTION","462, 476, CONTENT","415, 422, TRIGGER","482, 488, MODAL"}
7504	1. The novelty is unclear. The novelty should be clearly stated  in the manuscript. The novelty should be introduced  in relation to what has already been done in the literature, e.g. Adv. Appl. Sci. Res., 2013, 4, 331-341 should be discussed .	{"96, 102, MODAL","223, 229, MODAL","233, 242, ACTION","72, 82, LOCATION","48, 63, ACTION","39, 45, MODAL","84, 95, CONTENT","39, 45, MODAL","133, 137, TRIGGER","105, 116, ACTION","71, 82, LOCATION","184, 222, CONTENT","118, 177, CONTENT","27, 38, CONTENT","57, 64, ACTION"}
7505	2. The manuscript needs to be seriously proofread. The editing/writing needs revising since there are a lot of typos, incorrect numbering, vague expressions and grammar mistakes. The authors tend to use filler words a lot which impacted the comprehension of the manuscript.	{"6, 17, LOCATION","102, 177, CONTENT","77, 85, ACTION","71, 76, MODAL","222, 227, TRIGGER","7, 17, LOCATION","55, 70, CONTENT","17, 23, MODAL","40, 49, ACTION"}

7507	4. In the materials and methods section, the protocol of preparing the PMPS particles needs to be explained in details with clear schematic figures. Also, there is conflicting information mentioned in the section about the source of PMPS particles whether they were purchased from Exilica or prepared by the authors as claimed.	{"140, 147, LOCATION","108, 147, CONTENT","86, 91, MODAL","45, 85, CONTENT","212, 327, CONTENT","10, 39, LOCATION","205, 212, LOCATION","98, 107, ACTION","164, 187, CONTENT","188, 197, ACTION"}
7508	5. The physical characteristics of PMPS particles are critical in evaluating their adsorption properties. The authors should measure and include important features such as the adsorbent surface area and average pore diameter to complement Table 1, which currently has only few general properties.	{"125, 132, ACTION","248, 253, TRIGGER","118, 124, MODAL","239, 246, LOCATION","239, 246, LOCATION","118, 124, MODAL","145, 224, CONTENT","137, 144, ACTION"}

7511	8. The authors should explain how the standard deviations were obtained in Figure 2 and 3. Were independently prepared adsorbents used? How many times? It is crucial to demonstrate the reproducibility and reusability of the adsorbent.	{"15, 21, MODAL","21, 29, ACTION","30, 71, CONTENT","75, 89, LOCATION","140, 150, CONTENT","136, 139, TRIGGER","91, 95, TRIGGER","75, 83, LOCATION","30, 33, TRIGGER","15, 29, ACTION","95, 134, CONTENT"}
7512	9. A short paragraph on the trend toward sustainable and continuous water treatment processes should be added  with examples (Green Chem. 2015, 17, 5196-5205; Energy Environ. Sci. 2014, 7, 911-924), and the presented work should be briefly explained  from a sustainability perspective: what are the pros and cons of the submitted work with regards to sustainability and how to overcome the limitations?	{"111, 197, CONTENT","11, 20, LOCATION","286, 290, TRIGGER","103, 109, ACTION","94, 100, MODAL","286, 290, TRIGGER","203, 221, CONTENT","291, 401, CONTENT","239, 250, ACTION","222, 228, MODAL","104, 109, ACTION","94, 100, MODAL","3, 94, CONTENT"}

7514	12. “With the increase in flow rate there was a decrease in the empty bed contact time (EBCT), while the height of the mass transfer zone increased. At lower flow rate EE2 had more contact time with the PMPS particles, hence the lower EBCT” There seems to be a confusion here, since this sentence can interpreted in a way that the flow rate of adsorbate has no effect on the EBCT, if that is correct, how was EBCT decreased when the MTZ increased?	{"401, 404, TRIGGER","381, 383, TRIGGER","297, 300, MODAL","297, 300, MODAL","4, 240, LOCATION","247, 252, MODAL","37, 41, LOCATION","260, 270, ACTION","301, 312, ACTION","401, 404, MODAL","405, 446, CONTENT","312, 379, CONTENT","283, 296, LOCATION"}
7516	14. Continuous processing is the way forward and the authors should stress that in the manuscript. The potential of the column process the authors developed in continuous processing should be evaluated . Examples for recent continuous adsorption process from the literature should be discussed : Biochem. Eng. J. 2014, 87, 50-61; Green Chem. 2017, 19, 3116-3125.	{"296, 361, CONTENT","61, 67, MODAL","67, 74, ACTION","87, 97, LOCATION","181, 188, MODAL","192, 201, ACTION","273, 280, MODAL","4, 44, CONTENT","284, 293, ACTION","204, 273, CONTENT","87, 97, LOCATION","61, 74, ACTION","61, 67, MODAL","99, 181, CONTENT"}

7521	In the presented manuscript, the authors studied the effect of coagulant type on the surface properties of silica as well as the mechanical and abrasion properties of ESBR/silica WMB compound which could help industrialists in improving  the performance and the fuel efficiency of tires. The work is interesting from a fundamental point of view and it is also linked to an industrial application. The topic is of interest to a broad audience and suitable for the journal. However, there are several issues that must be addressed  prior to further consideration for publishing:	{"17, 27, LOCATION","511, 515, MODAL","192, 197, TRIGGER","17, 27, LOCATION","519, 528, ACTION","203, 236, ACTION","511, 515, MODAL","472, 479, TRIGGER","491, 505, CONTENT"}

7531	10.  In order to place the work in a broader context, the authors should include a short paragraph on the need for sustainable development, linking their work to aim improving fuel efficiency. The general discussion about the trend toward sustainable development should include broad examples, to stress that sustainable solutions are needed throughout various industrial sectors: e-waste (ACS Sustainable Chem. Eng., 2018, 6, 6507-6517), natural product extraction (Green Chem., 2017, 19, 3116-3125), oil production (Green Chem., 2017, 19, 1462-1489), solvent recovery (J. Membr.

7603	1. The Results section of the manuscript has an excessive amount of references making it unclear what is new result and what has been observed before. It is absolutely not clear what the new findings are in this manuscript, and what has been already observed before. For instance, in line 166 the authors give a measured value of 45 but then provide a reference. Is this measured by the authors or found in the literature cited? The manuscript needs to be carefully revised to avoid these mistakes and ambiguities. (see also lines 177-180, 188-202, entire page 8, lines 246-255)	{"371, 394, CONTENT","398, 427, CONTENT","395, 397, TRIGGER","363, 370, TRIGGER","183, 203, CONTENT","125, 149, CONTENT","120, 124, TRIGGER","102, 115, CONTENT","48, 64, ACTION","68, 78, CONTENT","97, 101, TRIGGER","89, 96, ACTION","267, 279, TRIGGER","233, 265, CONTENT","7, 22, LOCATION","30, 41, LOCATION","168, 177, ACTION","178, 183, TRIGGER","30, 40, LOCATION","97, 101, TRIGGER","212, 222, LOCATION","228, 233, TRIGGER","564, 577, LOCATION","549, 562, LOCATION","540, 547, LOCATION","531, 538, LOCATION","483, 513, CONTENT","477, 483, ACTION","466, 474, ACTION","444, 450, MODAL","433, 444, LOCATION","284, 292, LOCATION"}
7604	2. The objective of the work is actually defined in the middle of the Results sections (line 255).

7607	5. What was the rationale for the selection of 0.25 mL/mL concentration for the work? Is this from the literature? Why this particular value? Justification should be given in the manuscript.. Vague expressions should be avoided . Currently the manuscript has several sentences that are subjective, e.g.“increased quickly”,“slightly higher”,“dispersed adequately”,“certain of negative charge”,“far more connections”,“should have a certain conductivity”,“deviation was far less”	{"119, 140, CONTENT","94, 113, CONTENT","86, 93, TRIGGER","8, 71, CONTENT","259, 276, LOCATION","220, 228, ACTION","340, 362, LOCATION","363, 391, LOCATION","392, 414, LOCATION","415, 451, LOCATION","452, 476, LOCATION","179, 189, LOCATION","219, 227, ACTION","156, 162, MODAL","3, 7, TRIGGER","302, 321, LOCATION","322, 339, LOCATION","282, 296, ACTION","244, 255, LOCATION","210, 216, MODAL","192, 209, CONTENT","179, 189, LOCATION","166, 172, ACTION","156, 163, MODAL","142, 156, CONTENT","115, 119, TRIGGER","80, 84, LOCATION","3, 8, TRIGGER"}

7676	The material must be indicated as a major limitation of the study and should be discussed   – here and in Materials and Methods section.	{"4, 12, LOCATION","4, 13, CONTENT","13, 18, MODAL","21, 31, ACTION","36, 65, CONTENT","70, 77, MODAL","80, 92, ACTION","20, 90, ACTION","94, 99, LOCATION","13, 17, MODAL","106, 135, LOCATION"}
7677	Authors should extensively discuss the limitations of their study – all the limitations. It should be presented here, not as a conclusion.	{"8, 14, MODAL","92, 98, MODAL","39, 87, CONTENT","27, 35, ACTION","102, 111, ACTION","112, 116, LOCATION","112, 116, LOCATION","101, 111, ACTION","8, 14, MODAL","118, 122, TRIGGER","122, 137, CONTENT"}

7679	There is a really major problem associated with the risk of “guest authorship” procedure which is forbidden. Based on the information presented in this section there is the following problem: YCW – he did not participate in manuscript preparation at all – he should be indicated  rather in Acknowledgements Section	{"122, 143, CONTENT","109, 117, TRIGGER","147, 159, LOCATION","256, 259, CONTENT","166, 190, ACTION","89, 94, TRIGGER","259, 265, MODAL","268, 278, ACTION","224, 234, LOCATION","192, 196, CONTENT","201, 220, ACTION","224, 253, CONTENT","259, 266, MODAL","269, 278, ACTION","290, 314, LOCATION"}
7680	The manuscript by Palumbo et al. is of interest to the membrane community but there are major issues that need improvement or clarification before acceptance for publication in Membranes.	{"111, 123, ACTION","88, 100, CONTENT","106, 111, MODAL","74, 77, TRIGGER","126, 140, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","74, 77, TRIGGER"}
7681	1) The abstract is somewhat short and vague. Specify what‘ultrapure grade’ actually means. Quantify the statements‘deeply modifies’ and‘strong reduction’ as these informal expressions do not suffice a research article. More of these vague expressions occur at later stages of the article, e.g.“exceptional fast kinetics”.	{"157, 183, CONTENT","53, 57, TRIGGER","38, 43, ACTION","57, 74, LOCATION","7, 15, LOCATION","219, 250, CONTENT","184, 198, ACTION","135, 153, LOCATION","114, 131, LOCATION","104, 114, CONTENT","7, 16, LOCATION","28, 33, ACTION","45, 53, ACTION","91, 100, ACTION","201, 217, CONTENT","293, 320, LOCATION","251, 257, ACTION"}
7682	2) Avoid bulk referencing, e.g. in line 33 the references [1-6] should be replaced  with a review on the topic such as Chem. Rev., 2007, 107 (10), pp 4078–4110; and/or Journal of Colloid and Interface Science 314 (2007) 589–603.	{"64, 71, MODAL","64, 70, MODAL","73, 82, ACTION","35, 42, LOCATION","9, 25, CONTENT","3, 9, ACTION","74, 84, ACTION","91, 227, CONTENT","47, 63, LOCATION","35, 42, LOCATION"}
7683	3) The introduction briefly explains some of the previous works on metal based membranes for gas separation but it lacks any critical edge. The limitations/drawbacks of state-of-the-art prior literature should be mentioned, and linked to the current research by explaining how this new contribution by Palumbo et al. advances the field.	{"7, 19, LOCATION","228, 235, ACTION","213, 222, ACTION","203, 210, MODAL","108, 111, TRIGGER","144, 202, CONTENT","203, 209, MODAL","115, 120, ACTION","7, 20, LOCATION","108, 112, TRIGGER","242, 338, CONTENT","125, 138, CONTENT"}
7684	4) The introduction should have a paragraph on polymer-based membranes for gas/hydrogen separation mentioning their potential (http://dx.doi.org/10.1557/mrs2006.187; Polymer, 2013, 54, 4729-4761; Polym. Chem. 2010, 1, 63-68) and also their limitations with regards to temperature stability, selectivity and undesirable wastewater generation during fabrication (Green Chem., 2015, 17, 5196-5205; Macromolecules, 2012, 45, 3298–3311).	{"7, 20, LOCATION","7, 19, LOCATION","20, 27, MODAL","20, 26, MODAL","27, 32, ACTION","34, 434, CONTENT"}
7685	5) In Figure 1“Sample Temperature” is capitalised whilst“heat flow” isn’t. The space between the numbers and degreeC is missing. The consistency in formatting the article needs to be improved.	{"163, 170, LOCATION","6, 14, LOCATION","50, 56, TRIGGER","56, 67, LOCATION","68, 73, ACTION","133, 158, CONTENT","171, 177, MODAL","6, 14, LOCATION","183, 191, ACTION","14, 34, LOCATION","35, 49, ACTION","117, 127, ACTION","79, 116, CONTENT"}
7686	6) The font size for the text in the inset of Figure 1 needs to be larger as it is barely legible.	{"55, 61, MODAL","67, 74, ACTION","7, 29, CONTENT","25, 29, LOCATION","37, 54, LOCATION"}
7687	7) Section 2.1 is too short and contains only basic data interpretation without any in-depth analysis of the results. Why are these results important? What is the relevance of this data? What is the effect of the findings on the research? These questions need to be answered for both expert and non-expert readers to be able to follow the article. Without meaningful discussions on the results, the manuscript reads as a compilation of data.	{"118, 122, TRIGGER","192, 237, CONTENT","122, 149, CONTENT","3, 14, LOCATION","32, 45, ACTION","3, 14, LOCATION","46, 116, CONTENT","156, 185, CONTENT","266, 275, ACTION","255, 260, MODAL","151, 156, TRIGGER","151, 155, TRIGGER","187, 192, TRIGGER","239, 254, CONTENT","15, 27, ACTION"}
7688	8) What is H/M value? It is currently not defined in the manuscript.	{"8, 20, CONTENT","3, 7, TRIGGER","57, 67, LOCATION","57, 67, LOCATION","38, 49, ACTION","3, 8, TRIGGER"}
7689	9) Error bars and standard deviations are not given in the entire manuscript except Table 1. Have the experiments been repeated? Comments on the reproducibility of the results should be included  in the manuscript.	{"186, 196, ACTION","66, 77, LOCATION","3, 37, CONTENT","84, 91, LOCATION","77, 84, TRIGGER","185, 194, ACTION","66, 76, LOCATION","98, 127, CONTENT","203, 213, LOCATION","93, 97, TRIGGER","129, 175, CONTENT","176, 183, MODAL","176, 182, MODAL","38, 51, ACTION"}
7690	11) The conclusion section of the paper has some critical edge but does not directly mention the novelty of the work in relation to the literature. The qualitative statements should be complemented  with some quantitative results in the conclusion section.	{"8, 18, LOCATION","175, 181, MODAL","97, 146, CONTENT","63, 67, TRIGGER","237, 255, LOCATION","209, 229, CONTENT","185, 199, ACTION","34, 40, LOCATION","8, 26, LOCATION","67, 92, ACTION","63, 66, TRIGGER","184, 197, ACTION","175, 182, MODAL","152, 174, CONTENT"}
7691	12) The membrane preparation and hydrogen adsorption descriptions lack experimental details, and the suppliers of the materials/chemicals used are not mentioned. Consequently, the work is unreproducible. More technical details must be provided  in the experimental section.	{"180, 185, CONTENT","227, 231, MODAL","234, 243, ACTION","101, 142, CONTENT","71, 91, CONTENT","66, 71, ACTION","162, 174, TRIGGER","252, 272, LOCATION","235, 245, ACTION","227, 232, MODAL","204, 226, CONTENT","4, 65, CONTENT","143, 160, ACTION","185, 202, ACTION"}
7692	The authors adequately addressed most of the comments, and the manuscript significantly improved. However, there are several outstanding issues that needs to be addressed prior to further consideration for publishing:	{"117, 143, CONTENT","98, 105, TRIGGER","161, 171, ACTION","149, 155, MODAL","98, 105, TRIGGER","63, 73, LOCATION"}
7693	1. The authors should comment on the reproducibility of the emulsion preparation and the characterisation techniques. The authors replied that all experiments were repeated 2–4 times. Consequently, standard deviations should be shown in the figures and tables. The captions should have a sentence about the derivation of the error bars.	{"281, 286, ACTION","274, 281, MODAL","265, 274, LOCATION","37, 116, CONTENT","22, 30, ACTION","241, 248, LOCATION","15, 22, MODAL","15, 21, MODAL","228, 234, ACTION","218, 225, MODAL","288, 335, CONTENT","241, 249, LOCATION","198, 217, CONTENT","253, 259, LOCATION"}
7694	2. The figure captions should be more informative (e.g. Figure 4). Some of them are as short as a few words. The figures ad tables should stand on their own to facilitate understanding  the manuscript.	{"137, 184, ACTION","131, 138, MODAL","138, 156, ACTION","55, 64, LOCATION","113, 121, LOCATION","23, 30, MODAL","157, 200, CONTENT","124, 131, LOCATION","7, 22, LOCATION","30, 49, ACTION","23, 29, MODAL","56, 64, LOCATION"}
7695	3. The text in all figures should have the same font size.	{"7, 12, CONTENT","27, 34, MODAL","27, 33, MODAL","42, 57, CONTENT","7, 11, LOCATION","15, 26, LOCATION","34, 39, ACTION"}
7696	4. The introduction should contain a short paragraph on the need for sustainable development. The general discussion about the trend toward sustainable development should include broad examples, to stress that sustainable solutions are needed throughout various industrial sectors: e-waste (ACS Sustainable Chem. Eng., 2018, 6, 6507-6517), natural product extraction (Green Chem., 2017, 19, 3116-3125), oil production (Green Chem., 2017, 19, 1462-1489), solvent recovery (J. Membr. Sci., 2016, 514, 646-658), pharmaceutical manufacturing (ChemSusChem, 2017, 10, 3435-3444); and the present manuscript contributes to the sustainability efforts focusing on fuel efficiency.	{"20, 26, MODAL","94, 163, CONTENT","164, 171, MODAL","171, 179, ACTION","179, 572, CONTENT","590, 601, LOCATION","7, 20, LOCATION","7, 19, LOCATION","164, 178, ACTION","20, 27, MODAL","27, 35, ACTION","37, 92, CONTENT"}
7697	5. The authors should include the TGA thermograms for the silica content of ESBR/silica WMB in a Supporting Information file, instead of the main article.	{"15, 29, ACTION","126, 136, TRIGGER","34, 91, CONTENT","15, 22, MODAL","141, 153, LOCATION","22, 30, ACTION","97, 124, LOCATION"}
7698	6. Add tick marks on the x-axis of Figure 4 for better navigation.	{"35, 43, LOCATION","7, 17, CONTENT","25, 43, LOCATION","3, 7, ACTION"}
7699	7. The main research outcomes should be summarized  in some quantitative statement in the Conclusions section.	{"40, 52, ACTION","30, 36, MODAL","39, 50, ACTION","90, 109, LOCATION","30, 37, MODAL","73, 82, LOCATION","52, 82, CONTENT","7, 29, CONTENT"}
7700	The article presents an important study of micronutrient status among pregnant women in Niger. It is a very interesting manuscript, presenting very good, properly planned study, but with relatively poor discussion section, that needs to be polished. Also in the materials and methods section some issues must be explained and some other minor corrections are required .	{"262, 291, LOCATION","178, 181, TRIGGER","203, 221, LOCATION","304, 308, MODAL","228, 234, MODAL","311, 367, ACTION","359, 368, ACTION","120, 130, LOCATION","240, 248, ACTION","292, 303, CONTENT","326, 354, CONTENT","312, 322, ACTION","187, 202, ACTION","304, 309, MODAL","178, 181, TRIGGER","120, 130, LOCATION","4, 11, LOCATION"}
7701	The discussion section is relatively the weakest part of the study, because there are not enough elements of the discussion in the discussion. Authors present in many cases just repetition of results but without any references to literature. I understand, that in many cases there are no such references published, but they should try to find the other way to discuss them, e.g. they may try to indicate the possible reasons or consequences of observed situation.	{"23, 53, ACTION","395, 403, ACTION","338, 342, ACTION","151, 158, ACTION","97, 123, CONTENT","68, 76, TRIGGER","82, 96, ACTION","131, 141, LOCATION","173, 199, CONTENT","4, 14, LOCATION","324, 330, MODAL","200, 203, TRIGGER","408, 462, CONTENT","384, 388, MODAL","347, 372, CONTENT","324, 331, MODAL","315, 319, TRIGGER","204, 240, CONTENT","200, 203, TRIGGER","4, 22, LOCATION"}
7702	While in the discussion section the issue of declared reducing intake during pregnancy is indicated also the possible reasons should be mentioned . Is it possible that it is just the subjective assessment? Or it is real reducing, resulting from the fact that the physical activity may be reduced  (reduced duties at home?)?	{"100, 105, TRIGGER","148, 154, TRIGGER","154, 204, CONTENT","36, 99, CONTENT","126, 132, MODAL","135, 145, ACTION","209, 322, CONTENT","206, 209, TRIGGER","136, 146, ACTION","126, 133, MODAL","13, 31, LOCATION","109, 125, CONTENT","0, 5, TRIGGER","13, 23, LOCATION"}
7703	Taking into account the inclusion criteria, I think that some issues should be explained . It is not clearly presented if the week of pregnancy was in the exclusion criteria (i.e. was it possible that the woman at the end of her 3rd trimester would be enrolled  for the study?). Were there any other diseases (other than requiring immediate hospital referral and mental disability) that were in the exclusion criteria – e.g. diseases that cause lower micronutrients absorption, higher requirements (e.g. gastrointestinal diseases) or decreased immunity. If it was not taken into account, it should be analysed  in results section (how it disturbed results) or commented in the discussion section (how it could have disturbed the results).	{"187, 275, CONTENT","631, 634, TRIGGER","69, 75, MODAL","78, 88, ACTION","677, 687, LOCATION","119, 122, TRIGGER","126, 173, CONTENT","79, 89, ACTION","279, 289, TRIGGER","290, 552, CONTENT","554, 557, TRIGGER","557, 586, CONTENT","601, 609, ACTION","614, 629, LOCATION","629, 656, CONTENT","657, 660, TRIGGER","660, 670, ACTION","677, 695, LOCATION","696, 737, CONTENT","180, 186, TRIGGER","69, 76, MODAL","57, 68, CONTENT","591, 598, MODAL","94, 118, ACTION"}
7704	Moreover, in the study participants section it is indicated, that women were excluded from blood collection, while their Hb was < 7 g/dl. It also should be commented , as a fact that may had influenced the results observed in the study.	{"17, 43, LOCATION","0, 8, TRIGGER","146, 153, MODAL","156, 166, ACTION","146, 152, MODAL","173, 235, CONTENT","66, 136, CONTENT","155, 165, ACTION"}
7705	In the results section not all data must be presented  in tables. Especially, taking into account, that some data are presented in tables and afterwards once again – presented in the text, Authors should consider reducing  the number of tables. Some data may be just presented  in the text of manuscript and in the supplementary material.	{"315, 337, LOCATION","7, 22, LOCATION","23, 35, CONTENT","36, 41, MODAL","44, 55, ACTION","58, 64, LOCATION","197, 204, MODAL","245, 254, CONTENT","255, 259, MODAL","267, 278, ACTION","285, 303, LOCATION","58, 64, LOCATION","43, 53, ACTION","36, 40, MODAL","142, 152, TRIGGER","78, 187, CONTENT","66, 76, TRIGGER","213, 243, CONTENT","204, 212, ACTION"}
7706	While talking about high frequency of anemia, Authors should remember, that anemia is associated with poor status of some micronutrients, so indicating, that in the case of the pregnant anemic women their micronutrient status is unknown is some kind of simplification – it should be explained , that Authors think about complete analysis of micronutrients status.	{"283, 293, ACTION","71, 267, CONTENT","295, 362, CONTENT","54, 61, MODAL","61, 69, ACTION","273, 280, MODAL","0, 6, TRIGGER","6, 44, CONTENT","282, 292, ACTION","54, 60, MODAL"}

7708	Authors should properly present adequate background for their study – they should indicate what is the potential benefit of Moringa oleifera leaf and root powder with a specific benefit, not only the fact that it may be better than synthetic antioxidants (why exactly Moringa oleifera may be recommended , not other components?).	{"82, 91, ACTION","103, 254, CONTENT","256, 260, TRIGGER","260, 326, CONTENT","291, 303, ACTION","8, 14, MODAL","91, 95, TRIGGER","8, 14, MODAL","24, 32, ACTION","32, 67, CONTENT","75, 82, MODAL"}

7726	The manuscript by Rangel and co-workers details the fabrication and application of novel catalysts for CO oxidation at low temperature. The work covers the characterization of the catalysts as well as demonstrated their applicability. The results are new and fit well the scope of Catalysts. However, there are several technical and contextualization issues that should be addressed  prior to further consideration by the journal.	{"363, 370, MODAL","292, 299, TRIGGER","311, 357, CONTENT","373, 382, ACTION","372, 382, ACTION","292, 299, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","363, 369, MODAL","4, 14, LOCATION"}
7727	1. The abstract should have a single sentence to introduce the research motivation from a broad perspective.2. The introduction starts in medias res. The context of the work should be set first. What scientific problems and questions the work try to address?3. The scale bars on the SEM images should be visible. The resolution is too low to be able to see what length the scale bar actually represents.4. Reproducibility should be discussed . Were the catalysts prepared and tested several times? Standard deviations for the obtained data should be presented where possible, in particular Figures 9-10 where the CO conversion is presented.5. Closely related work on CO oxidation should be mentioned  in the introduction such as 10.3390/catal9030256; 10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.10.015; 10.1021/jacs.7b13624 (DOI).6. CO oxidation (in particular at low temperature) is pivotal to the abatement of exhaust gases and therefore ties in well with the increasingly important sustainability efforts in catalysis. A general paragraph on sustainability should be added  to the introduction. Briefly mention the different fields of sustainable solutions via catalysis such as biorefinery (10.1039/C8GC04017F), organocatalysis (10.1021/acscatal.8b01706), waste valorization (10.1039/C9GC00902G), hydrogen evolution (10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b05302), natural laterite (10.1021/acsanm.8b01117).7. The catalysts were washed with isopropanol. The amount expressed as “L solvent per kg catalyst” should be explicitly given under the experimental section. The scale of catalyst fabrication should also be revealed as currently the exact amounts are not disclosed under section 4.1.8. The recovery and reusability of the catalysts should be discussed  in the text. Have the authors performed any repeated experiments on used catalysts? Have they observed any performance decline? What are the criteria for reusing the catalysts? What is the expected lifetime of the catalysts?9. In order to minimize waste and address the sustainability requirements, the authors should mention that the isopropanol could be recycled  using sustainable membrane technologies (solvent recycling) and mention 10.1016/j.jcat.2019.01.041 example.10. The conclusion section should briefly mention the main limitations and drawbacks of the proposed catalysts, as well as the novelty of the presented work in relation to the existing literature.11. The figure and table captions are short in general. Elaborate on the captions for the readers to facilitate their understanding without having to read the entire text.	{"2561, 2565, LOCATION","184, 187, ACTION","265, 293, CONTENT","328, 338, ACTION","2429, 2437, ACTION","1424, 1430, CONTENT","1620, 1637, ACTION","2414, 2428, LOCATION","7, 16, LOCATION","16, 23, MODAL","23, 28, ACTION","30, 107, CONTENT","115, 128, LOCATION","154, 173, CONTENT","174, 181, MODAL","195, 200, TRIGGER","200, 257, CONTENT","294, 301, MODAL","304, 311, ACTION","317, 328, CONTENT","339, 402, CONTENT","406, 422, CONTENT","422, 429, MODAL","432, 442, ACTION","498, 539, CONTENT","540, 547, MODAL","590, 602, LOCATION","643, 679, CONTENT","680, 687, MODAL","690, 701, ACTION","708, 720, LOCATION","729, 807, CONTENT","1002, 1038, CONTENT","1038, 1044, MODAL","1048, 1053, ACTION","1062, 1074, LOCATION","1084, 1092, ACTION","1096, 1373, CONTENT","1444, 1471, LOCATION","1472, 1478, MODAL","1493, 1499, ACTION","1509, 1529, LOCATION","1535, 1564, CONTENT","1565, 1572, MODAL","1580, 1589, ACTION","1606, 1619, CONTENT","1644, 1658, LOCATION","1663, 1704, CONTENT","1705, 1712, MODAL","1715, 1726, ACTION","1733, 1737, LOCATION","1854, 1859, TRIGGER","1903, 1908, TRIGGER","2037, 2044, MODAL","2044, 2052, ACTION","2061, 2152, CONTENT","2156, 2164, ACTION","2164, 2199, CONTENT","2207, 2225, LOCATION","2226, 2233, MODAL","2241, 2249, ACTION","2253, 2395, CONTENT","2403, 2410, LOCATION","1859, 1901, CONTENT","2451, 2461, ACTION","2468, 2477, LOCATION","1815, 1852, CONTENT","1810, 1815, TRIGGER","1744, 1808, CONTENT","1739, 1744, TRIGGER","721, 728, TRIGGER","613, 639, CONTENT","603, 609, TRIGGER","550, 560, ACTION","444, 449, TRIGGER","7, 15, LOCATION","431, 441, ACTION","16, 22, MODAL","195, 199, TRIGGER","449, 496, CONTENT","576, 589, TRIGGER","560, 566, TRIGGER","566, 574, CONTENT","1908, 1949, CONTENT","1589, 1601, TRIGGER"}

7787	The manuscript by Yang et al. describes the preparation and application of Dy(III) doped BiOCl photocatalyst. The work is novel and the research is timely.

7789	2. Avoid superlatives and exaggeration. The entire manuscript needs to be revised. For instance,“superior photocatalytic activity” is claimed in line 16 but the sentence is incomplete and does not actually include the photocatalyst is superior to what.	{"74, 81, ACTION","218, 251, CONTENT","96, 130, LOCATION","9, 38, CONTENT","51, 61, LOCATION","153, 156, TRIGGER","62, 68, MODAL","51, 62, LOCATION","83, 95, TRIGGER","145, 152, LOCATION","3, 9, ACTION","188, 213, ACTION","153, 156, TRIGGER","157, 169, CONTENT","170, 183, ACTION"}
7790	3. What is the basis for the statement with“relative investigation reported in the last two years”? The literature on the topic is vast and a fully comprehensive review of 2 years of results, and their comparison with the presented photocatalyst is doubtful. Claims should be restricted to results supported  by quantitative analysis. Table 2 should be moved  to the Supporting Information, and the rationale for selecting its content (and omitting other similar works) should be explained .	{"246, 256, ACTION","290, 333, CONTENT","43, 98, LOCATION","3, 8, TRIGGER","3, 7, TRIGGER","266, 272, MODAL","275, 307, ACTION","29, 38, LOCATION","353, 360, ACTION","367, 389, LOCATION","399, 470, CONTENT","470, 477, MODAL","8, 39, CONTENT","196, 245, CONTENT","480, 490, ACTION","276, 287, ACTION","266, 273, MODAL","259, 266, CONTENT","343, 350, MODAL","335, 343, LOCATION"}
7791	4. Simply writing“washed several times” is insufficient.

7793	6. The photodegradation rate should be expressed as gram degraded  RhB over gram catalyst and unit time, e.g.“g g^-1 h^-1”, instead of % which is meaningless (Table 1). The concentration, volume and catalyst amount should be given in the table caption.	{"52, 122, CONTENT","137, 143, TRIGGER","159, 166, LOCATION","29, 35, MODAL","137, 142, TRIGGER","7, 28, CONTENT","29, 36, MODAL","39, 49, ACTION","173, 214, CONTENT","215, 222, MODAL","225, 231, ACTION","238, 251, LOCATION","109, 122, LOCATION","38, 65, ACTION","135, 136, CONTENT","124, 134, TRIGGER","143, 157, ACTION"}
7794	7. The manuscript starts in medias res. Instead, a brief paragraph should be added  on the recent trend toward sustainable catalysis and processing in general with broad examples to widen the context, e.g. agricultural waste treatment (Green Chem., 2017, 19, 3116-3125.), green biotechnology (Microb. Biotechnol., 2017, 10, 1171-1180), solvent recovery and reuse (J. Membr.

7796	9. The grammar and in particular the use of space throughout the manuscript is incorrect. A native speaker should revise the manuscript prior to submission. Spaces are either missing where they are needed or vice versa. In every single reference a lot of spaces are missing.	{"168, 175, TRIGGER","7, 50, CONTENT","65, 75, LOCATION","65, 76, LOCATION","248, 261, CONTENT","223, 245, LOCATION","183, 188, TRIGGER","183, 204, CONTENT","107, 114, MODAL","205, 207, TRIGGER","208, 218, CONTENT","107, 113, MODAL","114, 121, ACTION","125, 136, LOCATION","157, 164, CONTENT","175, 183, ACTION","262, 273, ACTION","76, 88, ACTION"}

7799	13. The figure captions are not informative enough. Elaborate on the figures and explain the main message of the figures so that they stand on their own. This will facilitate following and understanding  the manuscript. Moreover, the figure captions need to have individual text for each panel, e.g. Figure 3 has 5 panels, each panel need to be explained and referred to individually.	{"93, 152, CONTENT","258, 263, ACTION","250, 255, MODAL","69, 77, LOCATION","81, 89, ACTION","234, 249, LOCATION","345, 355, ACTION","334, 339, MODAL","323, 333, LOCATION","359, 370, ACTION","313, 321, CONTENT","300, 308, LOCATION","263, 293, CONTENT","52, 62, ACTION","8, 23, LOCATION","69, 76, LOCATION","163, 202, ACTION","220, 228, TRIGGER","220, 228, TRIGGER","24, 50, ACTION"}
7800	14. The SEM images revealed the same morphology for all samples, therefore it is sufficient to show only one image as a typical example, i.e. delete panels b-f) in Figure 5, or move them to a Supporting Information.

7806	1) The authors admit that there is a large number of studies on SPP enhanced absorption of pattern graphene arrays “strips, rings, crosses and so on”). However, there is no discussion about the aspects how the performance of the absorber proposed in this work could be better or different from the other arrays. A larger emphasis should be put on explaining the novelty of the work and comparing  the results with the previous works in this field. Especially, given that no experimental work has been carried out.	{"115, 149, LOCATION","347, 446, CONTENT","460, 512, CONTENT","152, 159, TRIGGER","260, 265, MODAL","448, 458, TRIGGER","340, 344, ACTION","330, 337, MODAL","170, 310, CONTENT","152, 159, TRIGGER","115, 149, LOCATION","336, 395, ACTION","314, 329, CONTENT"}

7817	The manuscript by Zhang and co-workers discusses the preparation and performance study of a nanocomposite ion-exchange membrane. The topic fits well in the scope of the journal and it is of interest to membrane scientists, chemical engineers and polymer chemists. A considerable amount of data is presented in the manuscript, and the results are interesting and novel. However, there are several major issues with respect to the presentation, technical aspects, and background/context, which should be carefully addressed  prior to further consideration for publishing in Materials.	{"492, 498, MODAL","388, 484, CONTENT","492, 499, MODAL","512, 523, ACTION","369, 376, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","501, 521, ACTION","369, 376, TRIGGER","314, 324, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION"}

7937	4. In the introduction, the authors mention the advantages and need for novel nanocomposite materials. It should be mentioned in the manuscript that there is a need  for materials enabling sustainable separation processes (give example, Green Chem., 2017, 19, 3116-3125.), and the INT-WS2-PHBV nanocomposite is a potential candidate for such purposes.	{"144, 351, CONTENT","10, 22, LOCATION","106, 112, MODAL","10, 22, LOCATION","115, 164, ACTION","116, 125, ACTION","106, 112, MODAL","133, 143, LOCATION"}

7945	As Authors compared groups, they should not use the words such as“increased”/“decreased” (as the observation of the same animals and changes in the function of time was not conducted), but instead they should use the words such as“was higher than”/“was lower than in the case of control group”.	{"77, 88, LOCATION","33, 39, MODAL","202, 212, ACTION","185, 188, TRIGGER","185, 188, TRIGGER","213, 294, CONTENT","65, 76, LOCATION","202, 208, MODAL","209, 212, ACTION","65, 76, LOCATION","33, 39, MODAL","40, 47, ACTION"}

7999	1. The abstract should be constructed in a way that the materials are introduced  first rather than their performance results. It should focus less on the results and more on the approach and the need for the research.	{"137, 142, ACTION","25, 80, ACTION","7, 15, LOCATION","16, 22, MODAL","26, 37, ACTION","37, 125, CONTENT","130, 136, MODAL","7, 15, LOCATION","16, 22, MODAL","143, 218, CONTENT"}
8000	2. What was the rational for the selection of the nitrate concentration? Instead of spiked samples, can the authors test their material on real wastewater samples?	{"3, 7, TRIGGER","16, 71, CONTENT","3, 7, TRIGGER","100, 103, MODAL","127, 135, LOCATION","116, 120, ACTION","121, 162, CONTENT"}

8002	4. How were the chemical bond formations confirmed after each reaction step during the preparation of the material? FTIR should be provided  after each step.	{"130, 139, ACTION","121, 127, MODAL","3, 6, TRIGGER","121, 127, MODAL","116, 120, CONTENT","131, 139, ACTION","16, 114, CONTENT","3, 6, TRIGGER","106, 114, LOCATION"}
8003	5. The authors should stress that chitosan is a green material and therefore the work contributes to the recent efforts in sustainable water treatment. Examples should given (Green Chem., 2015, 17, 5196-5205; Water 2013, 5, 292-311).	{"22, 28, ACTION","29, 151, CONTENT","152, 160, CONTENT","161, 167, MODAL","54, 62, LOCATION","15, 28, ACTION","174, 232, CONTENT","168, 173, ACTION","15, 21, MODAL","15, 21, MODAL"}
8004	6. Other approaches contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable agriculture should be mentioned  in the introduction to set the scene: J. Mater. Chem.

8006	8. Scheme 1 should have the experimental conditions on the arrows. The scheme should be restructured  in a more compact way. The structures should be redrawn with appropriate bond and bond angles.

8013	The review reads well and it is of interest to the journal. However, some recent literature and critical points are omitted which could be addressed  through a major revision.	{"130, 135, MODAL","60, 67, TRIGGER","60, 67, TRIGGER","69, 111, CONTENT","130, 135, MODAL","138, 148, ACTION","139, 148, ACTION"}

8016	- The authors refer to“high quality CNTs” but do not define what is meant by this expression. What are the criteria for high quality CNTs?	{"46, 59, ACTION","22, 41, LOCATION","68, 92, CONTENT","94, 98, TRIGGER","107, 137, CONTENT","22, 23, LOCATION","42, 45, TRIGGER","60, 64, TRIGGER"}
8017	- The differences among the types of CNT growth mechanisms showed in Figure 3 are ambiguous. It seems like there were four distinct mechanisms for CNT growth. However, the mechanism can be either VLS or VSS from the aspect of carbon atom’s state of matter and either tip-growth or base-growth depending on the position of the catalyst particle during the growth. Also, the difference between VLS and VSS mechanisms is difficult to illustrate properly in the presented way.	{"182, 185, MODAL","415, 441, ACTION","369, 414, CONTENT","159, 166, TRIGGER","69, 77, LOCATION","78, 91, ACTION","159, 166, TRIGGER","69, 77, LOCATION"}

8035	7. The section numbering is wrong. Section 2 and 2.1 appear twice under both the materials and results sections.	{"81, 90, LOCATION","35, 44, LOCATION","25, 33, ACTION","3, 24, CONTENT","95, 112, LOCATION","49, 52, LOCATION","35, 44, LOCATION"}
8036	8. The explanation of Figure 4 is not clear.

8038	The manuscript entitled“Is vitamin D deficiency related to molecular background of insulin resistance?” presents interesting issue, but it requires some major corrections before being published.	{"148, 170, CONTENT","4, 14, LOCATION","132, 135, TRIGGER","23, 103, LOCATION","132, 135, TRIGGER","139, 147, ACTION"}
8040	(2)    Authors should remove/ reduce a number of:	{"37, 49, CONTENT","15, 21, MODAL","22, 36, ACTION","15, 21, MODAL"}
8041	Authors should realize that they present the main part of the study in chapter 7, so all previous parts are not necessary and only the most essential information should be left.	{"15, 22, ACTION","126, 161, CONTENT","8, 14, MODAL","162, 168, MODAL","108, 121, ACTION","172, 176, ACTION","23, 67, CONTENT","85, 103, CONTENT","8, 14, MODAL","71, 80, LOCATION"}
8047	Title should be formulated  rather as a title for a scientific review, not as a title for a column of a newspaper (asking a question as a title is not recommended)	{"0, 5, LOCATION","40, 45, LOCATION","35, 163, CONTENT","6, 12, MODAL","15, 26, ACTION","16, 26, ACTION","6, 12, MODAL"}
8048	In spite of a fact that Authors prepared not research but a review article, their Abstract must have its structure (justification – aim – results – conclusions), so Authors must precisely specify what was the aim of their review, what results did they observe in their literature search and what was their conclusion based on indicated results.	{"188, 195, ACTION","82, 90, LOCATION","91, 95, MODAL","54, 57, TRIGGER","196, 344, CONTENT","82, 90, LOCATION"}
8049	In this section Authors should precisely justify the study – specify why they supposed that there is an association between vitamin D deficiency and insulin resistance.	{"61, 68, ACTION","49, 58, CONTENT","41, 48, ACTION","24, 30, MODAL","69, 168, CONTENT","3, 15, LOCATION","24, 30, MODAL"}
8050	Moreover, they should formulate the aim of the study.	{"0, 8, TRIGGER","15, 21, MODAL","32, 53, CONTENT","15, 31, ACTION","22, 31, ACTION"}
8054	The main problem is associated with the fact, that the study was planned and conducted for unknown number of batches, samples and repetitions, while for the plant material, due to very serious influence of the natural variability of the product, the multiple batches, samples and repetitions are necessary. In the study design it was indicated that the multiple batches were not assessed and number of samples/ repetitions also are not precisely indicated, so it seems that only one sample was assessed in repetitions. It must be clearly specified  in the Materials and methods section, as well as it must be discussed  as the limitation of the study.	{"163, 171, LOCATION","620, 650, CONTENT","353, 517, CONTENT","538, 547, ACTION","556, 585, LOCATION","529, 547, ACTION","609, 618, ACTION","522, 526, MODAL"}
8055	Authors should clearly indicate, that some species/ cultivars were unknown. They should specify for which samples the characteristics is known and describe it, and for which it is unknown. The information, that“Olive oil from Spain was commercially available (Carrefour, France)” is not relevant – readers will not contact Carrefour in order to ask for the species/ cultivars – Authors should either do it (get the information from the distributor and present in the study) or just indicate, that it was commercially available oil and species/ cultivars are unknown.	{"386, 392, MODAL","96, 187, CONTENT","407, 472, CONTENT","81, 87, MODAL","33, 74, CONTENT","23, 31, ACTION","210, 279, LOCATION","8, 14, MODAL","8, 14, MODAL","88, 95, ACTION","482, 490, ACTION","492, 566, CONTENT","81, 95, ACTION","280, 295, ACTION","100, 105, TRIGGER","210, 279, LOCATION","400, 405, ACTION"}
8056	While Authors planned to conduct comparison and present their data in tables, they must include also the statistical analysis of the data. While they did not include any statistical analysis – neither analysis of the normality of distribution, nor the comparison between results obtained for various oils, the conclusions are totally irrelevant. The observed results are for readers meaningless. The PCA analysis is not the properly conducted statistical analysis, as the data presented in tables are not analysed and not described properly. The only data that were statistically analysed are not presented in the manuscript, but as a supplementary file.	{"70, 76, LOCATION","70, 76, LOCATION","83, 95, ACTION","236, 239, TRIGGER","322, 344, ACTION","310, 321, LOCATION","359, 366, LOCATION","400, 412, LOCATION","472, 476, CONTENT","490, 496, LOCATION","88, 95, ACTION","101, 137, CONTENT","248, 304, CONTENT","201, 242, CONTENT","166, 190, CONTENT","150, 165, ACTION","501, 513, ACTION","518, 531, ACTION","593, 606, ACTION","551, 588, CONTENT","614, 624, LOCATION","635, 653, LOCATION"}
8057	Moreover, Authors presented mean and SD values, while they did not verify previously the normality of distribution. In the case of some of the data, distributions seem to be different than normal (e.g. in the case of trolox). For distribution was different than normal median values should be presented accompanied  by minimum and maximum values).	{"226, 283, CONTENT","292, 314, ACTION","283, 289, MODAL","303, 347, CONTENT","293, 302, ACTION","283, 289, MODAL"}
8058	Comparing various oils would be an interesting  aim of the study, if it is justified from the scientific point of view. Authors decided to compare the various oils, including very well known (e.g. olive oil) with rarely analysed oils. It should be explained and discussed , as well as the limitations of the study should be presented .	{"314, 320, MODAL","324, 333, ACTION","285, 313, CONTENT","28, 46, ACTION","238, 244, MODAL","238, 244, MODAL","248, 257, ACTION","262, 271, ACTION"}

8061	The manuscript by Jun-Chao and co-workers describes the modelling of MIL-101 pressure swing adsorption. The results are new and the topic fits well in the scope of the journal. However, there are several issues to be addressed before final decision can be made.	{"217, 226, ACTION","196, 210, CONTENT","4, 14, LOCATION","249, 252, MODAL","177, 184, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","177, 184, TRIGGER"}
8062	1, The rationale for the selection of MIL-101 should be given in the manuscript. Currently it is not clear why this particular adsorbent was selected for the work.	{"46, 52, MODAL","56, 61, ACTION","69, 79, LOCATION","69, 79, LOCATION","3, 45, CONTENT","107, 163, CONTENT","97, 106, ACTION","46, 52, MODAL"}
8063	2, Closely related pioneering research on modelling pressure swing CO2 adsorption with MOFs should be at least briefly discussed  (DOI 10.1039/C7TA02916K).	{"92, 98, MODAL","101, 128, ACTION","130, 154, CONTENT","119, 128, ACTION","92, 98, MODAL","3, 91, CONTENT"}
8064	3, Can the developed methodology be applied to other type of PSA processes having  different adsorbents and different gases/liquids? The limitations of the methodology should be briefly explained  in the text.	{"204, 208, LOCATION","6, 81, ACTION","168, 174, MODAL","7, 131, CONTENT","3, 6, TRIGGER","204, 208, LOCATION","133, 167, CONTENT","168, 174, MODAL","186, 195, ACTION"}

8066	6, The accuracy and reproducibility of the methods should be discussed  in the manuscript. Were any of the measurements repeated? If possible provide standard deviations.	{"51, 57, MODAL","61, 70, ACTION","79, 89, LOCATION","51, 57, MODAL","142, 149, ACTION","60, 70, ACTION","79, 89, LOCATION","150, 170, CONTENT","96, 128, CONTENT","91, 95, TRIGGER","3, 50, CONTENT"}
8067	7, The surface plots in Figure 7 are difficult to read. Include the tabulated data in a supporting information for the readers interested to see. It can be useful for further studies.	{"149, 152, MODAL","3, 20, CONTENT","56, 63, ACTION","24, 32, LOCATION","24, 32, LOCATION","63, 110, CONTENT"}

8069	The manuscript by Tolkou and Zouboulis details the GO/Fe coagulant composite for water treatment. The topic fits well in the C journal’s scope. The manuscript is well-written and sufficiently detailed but there are some points to be addressed before further consideration.	{"215, 226, CONTENT","201, 204, TRIGGER","233, 242, ACTION","201, 204, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION"}
8070	1) There is no report on the errors for the results presented in Figures 4 and 5. Since the curves for the GO and PFSiC1.5-15, for instance, are relatively close to each other, error bars should be added  to show if there is a clear difference between the materials, and reveal the reproducibility of the experiments.	{"188, 194, MODAL","188, 194, MODAL","271, 277, ACTION","278, 317, CONTENT","198, 203, ACTION","82, 187, CONTENT","205, 265, CONTENT","65, 80, LOCATION","65, 74, LOCATION","197, 203, ACTION"}
8071	2) The scale bars are not visible in Figure 2. Enlarge the text above the bars in order to make them legible.

8072	3) The limitations and drawbacks of the proposed materials and methodologies should be mentioned  in the manuscript including the scale of the water treatment process.	{"77, 83, MODAL","105, 115, LOCATION","87, 96, ACTION","77, 83, MODAL","3, 76, CONTENT","86, 96, ACTION","127, 166, CONTENT","105, 115, LOCATION","116, 125, ACTION"}
8073	4) Some introduction to graphene is given, however diverse composite examples for water treatment should be mentioned  (DOIs 10.1021/sc5001176, 10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118007).	{"43, 50, TRIGGER","107, 117, ACTION","8, 20, LOCATION","51, 97, CONTENT","120, 172, CONTENT","43, 50, TRIGGER","108, 117, ACTION","98, 104, MODAL","98, 104, MODAL"}

8077	My general doubt is associated with the fact that in my opinion, the manuscript is rather within the scope of the“Sustainability” journal (https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability), than IJERPH journal. Readers interested in the deepen analysis of the issues of sustainability are rather looking for articles interesting for them in“Sustainability” journal than in any other. In my opinion, withdrawing manuscript and submitting to the“Sustainability” journal would be beneficial for readers but also for Authors (due to better publicity of their work).	{"463, 468, MODAL","69, 79, LOCATION","394, 405, ACTION","421, 431, ACTION","432, 462, CONTENT","406, 416, CONTENT","495, 498, TRIGGER"}

8096	The main issue is associated with the fact, that Authors not only did not include the probiotics treatment into their review, but they also even did not mention about possibility of modifying intestinal microbiota, as the therapy method in patients with IBS. Taking into account, that not only patients, but also MDs are very interested in more“natural” therapeutical methods (such as diet modification or probiotics), the probiotic treatment should be incorporated  into review. Authors should indicate in their manuscript the studies indicating , that probiotics may alleviate syndroms of IBS (e.g. meta-analysis of Hoveyda et al. 2009 - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19220890) but at the same time, they must remember, that current data is insufficient to conclude undoubtedly about the possible influence of probiotics and they must indicate it in their article.	{"472, 478, LOCATION","524, 594, CONTENT","843, 851, ACTION","864, 871, LOCATION","453, 465, ACTION","718, 726, ACTION","838, 842, MODAL","513, 523, LOCATION","495, 503, ACTION","488, 494, MODAL","126, 129, TRIGGER","66, 81, ACTION","443, 449, MODAL","82, 106, CONTENT","118, 124, LOCATION","452, 465, ACTION","145, 160, ACTION","167, 213, CONTENT","218, 257, CONTENT","423, 442, CONTENT","601, 684, CONTENT","230, 236, LOCATION","713, 717, MODAL","728, 828, CONTENT","443, 449, MODAL"}
8099	There are some presented therapy methods without safety/ tolerability specified in the manuscript (e.g. lines 240-248, 259-271, 273-284, 336-346). If possible, Authors should specify what is the safety of indicated therapeutic option, what are the possible side effects, were there any adverse events observed, etc., in order to provide the complex information for the readers. Without it, the article is incomplete.	{"175, 182, ACTION","282, 309, CONTENT","271, 275, TRIGGER","240, 269, CONTENT","235, 239, TRIGGER","188, 233, CONTENT","183, 187, TRIGGER","25, 69, CONTENT","87, 97, LOCATION","168, 182, ACTION","183, 187, TRIGGER","104, 117, LOCATION","119, 126, LOCATION","128, 135, LOCATION","137, 144, LOCATION","337, 376, CONTENT","329, 336, ACTION","168, 174, MODAL"}

8114	8) The full IUPAC name of the compounds in the main text is unnecessary and makes it difficult to follow the manuscript. Compound numbers are sufficient and the full names can be mentioned  in the supporting information.	{"76, 104, ACTION","197, 219, LOCATION","109, 119, LOCATION","138, 152, ACTION","52, 56, LOCATION","178, 188, ACTION","60, 71, ACTION","172, 175, MODAL","121, 137, CONTENT","7, 39, CONTENT","47, 56, LOCATION","172, 176, MODAL","179, 190, ACTION","161, 171, CONTENT"}

8122	18) In the conclusions the authors claim that they have developed“appropriate in process checks and strategies in order to control these impurities within the acceptable level”. However, these strategies are not explained in the article, and the acceptable levels are not discussed in the manuscript. In general the conclusions section is too short and vague needing more elaboration and quantitative discussions, e.g. what are the impurity levels and detection limits etc.	{"353, 358, ACTION","339, 348, ACTION","367, 383, ACTION","432, 468, CONTENT","178, 185, TRIGGER","65, 176, LOCATION","208, 221, ACTION","401, 412, ACTION","316, 335, LOCATION","65, 176, LOCATION","178, 185, TRIGGER","11, 22, LOCATION","268, 281, ACTION","187, 203, CONTENT","289, 299, LOCATION","419, 424, TRIGGER","359, 366, MODAL","246, 263, CONTENT","229, 236, LOCATION"}
8123	The manuscript is a critical review on opportunities for the management of biosolids with a focus on pyrolysis and the possible application of the solid fraction of pyrolysis into soil amelioration. Pyrolysis of biosolids leads to several benefits, compared to the traditional landfilling, incineration or land application, e.g. destruction of pathogens, potential to recover energy and obtaining a solid product which can be used  as soil amendment. The manuscript reads well, however, there are mistakes and shortcomings which must be corrected  prior to further consideration for publication.	{"4, 14, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","425, 430, ACTION","419, 422, MODAL","413, 418, TRIGGER","497, 522, CONTENT","455, 466, LOCATION","537, 548, ACTION","529, 534, MODAL","478, 485, TRIGGER"}

8125	2) There are no illustrating figures in the review except two tables. Consequently, the manuscript is is difficult digest and non-comprehensible. Comparative graphs and tables are necessary for the understanding of the manuscript for non-specialise readers, particularly in Section 3.2. and Section 3.4. Add at least 4-5 figures and a few more tables on the key points.	{"3, 15, ACTION","70, 82, TRIGGER","126, 144, ACTION","105, 121, ACTION","274, 286, LOCATION","291, 303, LOCATION","304, 307, ACTION","317, 328, CONTENT","335, 368, CONTENT","176, 189, ACTION","146, 175, CONTENT","88, 98, LOCATION","29, 36, LOCATION","44, 50, LOCATION","16, 36, CONTENT","258, 270, TRIGGER"}

8142	In the presented work, the authors investigated the filtration performance of different mixed media columns for the removal of TSS, BOD, COD, T-N and T-P from stormwater. The manuscript has a potentially interesting premise which could add to the knowledge base of handling  nonpoint source water pollution. Overall, the work is suitable for publication in water, however the following points need to be addressed first.	{"224, 229, TRIGGER","376, 392, CONTENT","175, 186, LOCATION","404, 414, ACTION","364, 372, TRIGGER","393, 398, MODAL","308, 315, TRIGGER","175, 185, LOCATION","235, 273, ACTION","7, 21, LOCATION"}

8147	5. The authors selected natural filter media, which is a great advantage for water treatment processes, and can be considered  a sustainable approach. A short paragraph on the trend toward sustainable water treatment processes should be added  with examples (Green Chem. 2015, 17, 5196-5205; Energy Environ. Sci. 2014, 7, 911-924), and the presented work should be briefly explained  from a sustainability perspective: what are the pros and cons of the submitted work with regards to sustainability and how to overcome the limitations?	{"46, 51, TRIGGER","108, 111, MODAL","419, 424, TRIGGER","503, 507, TRIGGER","340, 354, LOCATION","114, 125, ACTION","237, 244, ACTION","355, 362, MODAL","227, 234, MODAL","424, 498, CONTENT","151, 226, CONTENT","507, 534, CONTENT","259, 329, CONTENT","373, 384, ACTION","159, 168, LOCATION"}
8148	6. Vague and informal statements and expressions such as“that filtration process is in general excellent for particle material” and“there are a little unique result” should be avoided .	{"175, 183, ACTION","56, 127, LOCATION","176, 184, ACTION","166, 172, MODAL","3, 48, CONTENT","56, 127, LOCATION","131, 165, LOCATION","166, 173, MODAL"}

8151	9. In the results and discussion section, the authors state the adsorption effect as the main factor for the high removal efficiency of T-P without providing evidence for this phenomenon. For example, comparing the adsorption affinity of T-N and T-P by conducting zeta potential measurements for analysing the negatively charged ions in the solution.

8210	6, The authors mention the immobilization of catalysts into membrane matrix. Some recent diverse examples of this expanding field should be briefly mentioned  (DOIs 10.1021/acscatal.8b01706; 10.1039/C8PY01789A; 10.1016/j.memsci.2019.117485); introduction line 61.	{"139, 157, ACTION","242, 254, LOCATION","159, 240, CONTENT","255, 262, LOCATION","242, 255, LOCATION","82, 129, CONTENT","148, 159, ACTION","130, 136, MODAL","130, 137, MODAL"}

8214	10, The actual values of tensile strength and elongation at break should be briefly compared  with other types of membrane materials to place the new membranes in a context and see how they differ (DOIs 10.1016/j.memsci.2015.12.057; 10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b02516; 10.1016/j.memsci.2019.117512).	{"66, 73, MODAL","75, 92, ACTION","84, 94, ACTION","181, 184, TRIGGER","99, 132, CONTENT","136, 142, ACTION","146, 172, CONTENT","8, 65, CONTENT","198, 292, CONTENT","177, 196, ACTION","66, 72, MODAL"}
8215	11, The volumes for the soaking and washing of the membranes should be reported  as L/m2 under the experimental section of the manuscript.	{"127, 137, LOCATION","70, 79, ACTION","61, 68, MODAL","71, 81, ACTION","99, 119, LOCATION","61, 67, MODAL","8, 60, CONTENT","84, 88, CONTENT","127, 137, LOCATION"}
8216	12, The manuscript needs to go through a thorough proofreading and editing as there are multiple typos and grammar mistakes throughout the text. Either a native speaker or an editing service should be utilized  to improve the manuscript.	{"191, 198, MODAL","154, 190, CONTENT","145, 151, TRIGGER","226, 236, LOCATION","139, 143, LOCATION","8, 18, LOCATION","8, 18, LOCATION","191, 197, MODAL","50, 62, ACTION","88, 123, CONTENT","19, 25, MODAL","67, 74, ACTION","214, 221, ACTION","200, 209, ACTION"}
8217	The manuscript by Pinto et al. chronologically summarizes the development of the membrane-assisted enantiomeric separation methods. The topic and the presentation could become suitable for publication in the journal if the authors carefully address the following  issues. In general, the article contains several grammatical mistakes and must be thoroughly revised  by a native speaker. Furthermore, both the quantity and quality of the figures must be increased . My detailed comments can be found below.	{"241, 249, ACTION","387, 398, TRIGGER","357, 366, ACTION","253, 270, CONTENT","305, 333, CONTENT","486, 490, MODAL","499, 504, LOCATION","409, 444, CONTENT","387, 398, TRIGGER","493, 499, ACTION","453, 463, ACTION","136, 162, CONTENT","288, 295, LOCATION","445, 450, MODAL","4, 14, LOCATION","338, 342, MODAL","163, 169, MODAL","4, 14, LOCATION","168, 262, ACTION","468, 485, CONTENT","338, 343, MODAL"}

8220	3. [Line 39–43] The authors describe the use of the“racemic approach” in chiral synthesis. However, the reasoning behind this “to evaluate the differences in activity and toxicity of both enantiomers in order to maximize the effectiveness of the product while minimizing the possible negative side effects.”) is only partly true. The main reason (the absence or availability of the racemic approach) should also be included in the text.	{"400, 407, MODAL","91, 98, TRIGGER","91, 98, TRIGGER","4, 11, LOCATION","431, 435, LOCATION","312, 328, ACTION","100, 120, CONTENT","415, 424, ACTION","126, 307, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","51, 69, LOCATION","334, 399, CONTENT","400, 406, MODAL"}
8221	4. [Line 48–52] The dynamic kinetic resolution method (Noyori, Tetrahedron: Asymmetry, 1990, 1, 1-4) should be included  in the reference list.	{"101, 107, MODAL","101, 108, MODAL","20, 100, CONTENT","111, 121, ACTION","128, 142, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","110, 119, ACTION","4, 11, LOCATION"}
8222	5. [Introduction] The authors describe the advantages of the membrane methods, however, the major drawbacks should also be included as well. In general, the introduction should describe the requirements for membranes to be used for the separation of enantiomers.	{"123, 132, ACTION","132, 139, TRIGGER","177, 186, ACTION","115, 119, TRIGGER","170, 177, MODAL","79, 86, TRIGGER","108, 115, MODAL","108, 114, MODAL","170, 185, ACTION","157, 169, LOCATION","92, 107, CONTENT","4, 16, LOCATION","190, 261, CONTENT","79, 86, TRIGGER","4, 16, LOCATION"}

8224	7. [Figure 1] The shape and the resolution of the figure is not sufficient for publication, it should be re-drawn. Furthermore, the figure should have colours similar to the other figures.	{"4, 12, LOCATION","115, 126, TRIGGER","139, 146, MODAL","95, 102, MODAL","18, 56, CONTENT","132, 138, LOCATION","146, 158, ACTION","4, 12, LOCATION","57, 74, ACTION","95, 101, MODAL","115, 126, TRIGGER","105, 113, ACTION"}
8225	8. [Figure 1] A more detailed explanation about the figure should be written in the text (e.g. differences, advantages/disadvantages, applicability).	{"4, 12, LOCATION","69, 77, ACTION","59, 65, MODAL","89, 148, CONTENT","59, 66, MODAL","4, 12, LOCATION","84, 89, LOCATION","16, 58, CONTENT"}
8226	9. [Line 46–52] The long list of techniques should include molecular imprinting  (ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 2015, 7, 9516–9525) and optical force (Sci.

8227	10. [Line 123–125] The authors explain the difficulties of the“chiral separation with membranes from chiral polymers alone”. However, this statement is partially true. The chiral separation is based on the effectiveness of the molecular interactions. If the flexible side chain contains the chiral component and the interaction is strong, the separation might be efficient. The aforementioned phenomena should be included  in the text with a brief explanation.	{"134, 148, CONTENT","430, 435, LOCATION","152, 166, ACTION","5, 13, LOCATION","442, 459, CONTENT","5, 17, LOCATION","62, 123, LOCATION","125, 132, TRIGGER","403, 410, MODAL","413, 423, ACTION","125, 132, TRIGGER","378, 402, CONTENT","168, 373, CONTENT","412, 421, ACTION","354, 359, MODAL"}

8239	4) Line 133:“The white precipitate was recovered through filtration and the volatile solvents were evaporated, resulting in a white powder.” Please clarify this part. Were the filtered white precipitate and the residue after solvent evaporation combined? Or was the filtered white precipitate discarded?	{"255, 257, TRIGGER","3, 11, LOCATION","12, 140, LOCATION","262, 302, CONTENT","258, 261, TRIGGER","167, 171, TRIGGER","156, 165, CONTENT","3, 11, LOCATION","172, 252, CONTENT","148, 156, ACTION"}

8245	10) Are there any results about reproducibility of the polymerisation procedure? Were the NP preparations duplicated or triplicated? Were the materials reused? Discussions on these points should be included when the results are presented . In particular, robustness of similar crosslinked polymers was demonstrated in the literature, pointing out the importance of the regeneration method (Polym. Chem., 2017, 8, 666-673), which should be mentioned  in the manuscript.	{"439, 450, ACTION","457, 467, LOCATION","198, 207, ACTION","382, 388, LOCATION","207, 211, TRIGGER","14, 79, CONTENT","255, 421, CONTENT","197, 237, ACTION","138, 158, CONTENT","423, 428, TRIGGER","212, 237, CONTENT","188, 194, MODAL","188, 195, MODAL","429, 436, MODAL","160, 171, CONTENT","86, 131, CONTENT","133, 137, TRIGGER","4, 13, TRIGGER","207, 211, TRIGGER","81, 85, TRIGGER"}

8249	1.       The number of animals in a group is insufficient to conclude, as Authors had in their study 4 animals in each group. So based on such number of animals, they can not have reliable observations, due to a natural variability in animal models. Authors stated, that their“sample size was calculated on the basis of the mean on the daily amount of diet consumption” – it is rather impossible as they must have had the animals previously, before observing their intake.	{"13, 41, CONTENT","45, 69, ACTION","167, 179, ACTION","167, 170, MODAL","276, 369, LOCATION","421, 471, CONTENT","378, 385, TRIGGER","180, 201, CONTENT","409, 417, ACTION","276, 369, LOCATION","404, 409, MODAL","385, 395, ACTION"}
8250	2.       The problem indicated by Authors is not justified and it seems to be trivial, as Authors compared diet with no vitamin D at all (0 IU), moderate amount of vitamin D (1400 IU/ kg) and high amount of vitamin D (4000 IU/ kg). The resultant conclusions are identical as supposed – lack of vitamin D in diet will cause the symptoms of its deficit.	{"107, 230, CONTENT","312, 316, MODAL","42, 58, ACTION","63, 85, ACTION","13, 41, CONTENT"}

8289	Introduction - authors indicate the problem with folate deficiencies in Serbia as a country without folates fortification policy, but after reading the introduction, reader may jump to conclusions, that it is a problem observed exclusively in Serbia. In such situation, the article would not be interesting for international readers and should be published   rather in Serbian journal. I understand, that it was only an example (as e.g. in Poland also no such policy is observed), so authors should specify it, indicating in what other countries such problems associated with lack of fortification policy are being observed.	{"499, 507, ACTION","492, 499, MODAL","130, 134, TRIGGER","507, 509, CONTENT","173, 176, MODAL","130, 133, TRIGGER","347, 359, ACTION","511, 522, ACTION","337, 344, MODAL","282, 288, MODAL","306, 332, CONTENT","0, 13, LOCATION","203, 249, CONTENT","288, 306, ACTION","369, 384, CONTENT","152, 164, LOCATION","274, 281, LOCATION","359, 365, TRIGGER","294, 357, ACTION","522, 623, CONTENT","152, 164, LOCATION"}

8311	4) The authors claimed that a systematic fouling study was provided. However, only one type of membrane was investigated within their studies. The authors should explain and clarify in the main text what is meant by systematic.	{"69, 76, TRIGGER","155, 162, MODAL","204, 226, CONTENT","78, 82, ACTION","83, 120, CONTENT","162, 170, ACTION","134, 141, LOCATION","199, 203, TRIGGER","174, 182, ACTION","155, 169, ACTION","194, 198, LOCATION","189, 198, LOCATION","69, 76, TRIGGER"}
8312	5) Figure 1 and Figure 3 provide the same information. The number of figures in this manuscript is excessive. The number of figures should be minimized , and data duplication should be avoided . Therefore, Figure 1 and Figure 3 should be combined  (with two‘x’ axes) or Figure 3 should be moved  to the supplementary information. Similarly, Figure 5 and Figure 6 provide the same data in different representation form. Therefore Figure 5 should be omitted and placed  within the supplementary information.	{"270, 278, LOCATION","37, 53, CONTENT","85, 95, LOCATION","206, 214, LOCATION","219, 227, LOCATION","363, 384, ACTION","429, 437, LOCATION","438, 445, MODAL","448, 456, ACTION","460, 468, ACTION","479, 504, LOCATION","419, 429, TRIGGER","354, 362, LOCATION","341, 349, LOCATION","3, 11, LOCATION","16, 24, LOCATION","59, 76, CONTENT","96, 108, ACTION","132, 139, MODAL","142, 152, ACTION","114, 131, CONTENT","175, 182, MODAL","185, 193, ACTION","158, 174, CONTENT","228, 235, MODAL","238, 248, ACTION","279, 286, MODAL","289, 296, ACTION","303, 328, LOCATION","132, 138, MODAL","141, 151, ACTION","3, 11, LOCATION"}
8313	6) The authors collected 100 mL permeate at 60 Lm^-2h^-1. With a membrane area of 12.7 cm^2 the washing and compaction of membrane were performed 1.31 h. Is the time provided sufficient for the membrane compaction? Did the authors investigate the TMP during the compaction process? The authors should ensure steady-state TMP prior to the fouling studies as it could affect the results.	{"219, 280, CONTENT","308, 324, CONTENT","301, 308, ACTION","325, 333, TRIGGER","41, 46, LOCATION","294, 301, MODAL","157, 213, CONTENT","366, 384, CONTENT","215, 218, TRIGGER","354, 356, TRIGGER","334, 353, CONTENT","294, 300, MODAL","360, 366, MODAL","154, 156, TRIGGER"}
8314	7) In Figure 6, the authors only fitted linear trend on 4 out of 6 data points (for datasets 0% SA – 100% BSA). It is incorrect to assume that the exponent of that linear trend is 0.4 and correlates with the exponent reported in the literature, as the trend was not fitted to all the data.	{"6, 14, LOCATION","258, 272, ACTION","6, 14, LOCATION","248, 257, CONTENT","245, 247, TRIGGER","143, 243, CONTENT","138, 142, TRIGGER","33, 110, CONTENT","28, 32, ACTION","276, 288, CONTENT","118, 137, ACTION"}
8315	8) There are data missing for 25% and 50% SA resistance at 75 L m^-2h^-1 and for 75% resistance at 88 L m^-2h^-1 (Figure 5). Why were the data omitted? The authors should explain why those data were not presented within the manuscript.	{"56, 61, LOCATION","30, 112, CONTENT","13, 18, CONTENT","171, 179, ACTION","114, 122, LOCATION","224, 234, LOCATION","125, 129, TRIGGER","164, 171, MODAL","183, 212, CONTENT","164, 178, ACTION","129, 150, CONTENT","18, 26, ACTION","179, 182, TRIGGER"}
8316	9) Fouling resistance works on UF membranes should be mentioned  in the introduction (J. Membr. Sci., 2017, 541, 300-311; J. Membr. Sci., 2017, 533, 141-159).	{"72, 84, LOCATION","84, 157, CONTENT","3, 43, CONTENT","54, 65, ACTION","72, 84, LOCATION","53, 63, ACTION","44, 51, MODAL","44, 50, MODAL"}

8318	11) What was the rationale for choosing PAN for the membrane material? The authors should explain within the manuscript.	{"109, 119, LOCATION","83, 90, MODAL","90, 98, ACTION","4, 8, TRIGGER","83, 97, ACTION","4, 9, TRIGGER","61, 69, LOCATION","9, 69, CONTENT"}
8319	12) What was the rationale for choosing the total organic matter concentration 30 mg L^-1 and the concentration of BSA and SA? Are the selected concentration values relevant to the industry? The authors should explain within the manuscript.	{"4, 9, TRIGGER","4, 8, TRIGGER","203, 217, ACTION","229, 239, LOCATION","9, 89, CONTENT","94, 125, CONTENT","127, 130, TRIGGER","131, 189, CONTENT","229, 239, LOCATION","210, 218, ACTION","203, 210, MODAL"}
8320	13) The authors should acknowledge in the introduction the previous report (ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 2017, 9, 11279–11289) detailing the effect of solvent conditioning of membranes. Solvent treatment of membranes can significantly alter the membrane performance and could mitigate the fouling   of membranes.	{"42, 54, LOCATION","220, 297, ACTION","42, 54, LOCATION","23, 35, ACTION","16, 23, MODAL","59, 126, CONTENT","127, 137, ACTION","137, 184, CONTENT","16, 22, MODAL"}
8321	14) The authors should include flux recovery studies within the manuscript.	{"64, 74, LOCATION","64, 74, LOCATION","31, 52, CONTENT","16, 30, ACTION","23, 31, ACTION","16, 23, MODAL"}
8322	15) The authors should provide a process scheme for their fouling  studies.	{"33, 74, CONTENT","23, 31, ACTION","22, 65, ACTION","16, 23, MODAL"}
8323	16) The authors should avoid bulk referencing  i.e., [24–29].	{"16, 23, MODAL","23, 29, ACTION","29, 45, CONTENT","22, 45, ACTION","53, 60, LOCATION"}
8324	17) The authors should provide a comparison table within the manuscript which summarizes and compares the obtained fouling  results (i.e., correlation of specific resistance data or flux recovery) in the presented study with the results obtained in the literature.	{"93, 102, ACTION","204, 219, LOCATION","72, 77, TRIGGER","78, 89, ACTION","22, 122, ACTION","61, 71, LOCATION","61, 72, LOCATION","33, 49, CONTENT","23, 31, ACTION","16, 23, MODAL","106, 196, CONTENT"}

8326	19) The space occupied by figures should be kept at minimum. I.e., Instead of placing the figure panels below each other (Figure 4) occupying one and a half pages, the panels can be placed  next to each other, occupying only half a page. Similarly, the space occupied by Figure 9 and Figure 10 can be minimized .	{"182, 190, ACTION","44, 59, ACTION","122, 130, LOCATION","301, 311, ACTION","190, 236, CONTENT","34, 40, MODAL","8, 13, CONTENT","175, 179, MODAL","271, 279, LOCATION","253, 267, CONTENT","26, 33, LOCATION","284, 293, LOCATION","294, 298, MODAL","238, 247, TRIGGER","168, 174, LOCATION","26, 33, LOCATION","181, 188, ACTION","34, 41, MODAL","78, 120, CONTENT","67, 77, TRIGGER"}
8327	20) All panels within a figure should be labelled  (A, B, C, D). All panels should be described  within the figure caption.	{"76, 83, MODAL","31, 37, MODAL","40, 49, ACTION","31, 38, MODAL","24, 30, LOCATION","4, 14, CONTENT","108, 122, LOCATION","69, 75, CONTENT","86, 97, ACTION","41, 51, ACTION"}
8328	21) The quality of Figure 10 and Figure 12 is low. The authors should improve the figure quality.	{"33, 42, LOCATION","19, 28, LOCATION","63, 69, MODAL","19, 28, LOCATION","63, 70, MODAL","8, 15, CONTENT","43, 49, ACTION","70, 78, ACTION","82, 96, CONTENT"}
8329	22) The title of axes on Figure 11 is not legible. All axes titles, units and information on figures should be legible.	{"8, 21, CONTENT","8, 13, LOCATION","101, 107, MODAL","93, 100, LOCATION","25, 34, LOCATION","35, 49, ACTION","101, 108, MODAL","111, 118, ACTION","51, 89, CONTENT"}
8330	23) The authors should be consistent throughout the manuscript. I.e., ? is usually used for resistance on the y axis title, however, in Figure 5“initial specific resistance” was used as the axis title. Another example is the different font size or font style used for the panel labels.	{"144, 173, LOCATION","124, 131, TRIGGER","52, 62, LOCATION","16, 23, MODAL","23, 36, ACTION","92, 122, CONTENT","52, 62, LOCATION","136, 144, LOCATION","124, 131, TRIGGER","16, 22, MODAL"}
8331	The manuscript entitled „Foods as a possible preventive /co-therapeutic strategy against COVID-19” presents interesting issue, but some areas must be corrected .	{"127, 130, TRIGGER","142, 146, MODAL","149, 159, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION","150, 160, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION","24, 98, LOCATION","131, 141, CONTENT","142, 147, MODAL"}
8332	The manuscript by Martikainen and co-workers describes wastewater treatment with sand filters in Finland. The work is novel, a reasonable amount of data is presented. In general the topic is of interests to the readers of water. However, there are some issues that must be addressed  prior to publication.	{"4, 14, LOCATION","229, 236, TRIGGER","265, 269, MODAL","248, 259, CONTENT","265, 270, MODAL","4, 14, LOCATION","272, 282, ACTION","273, 284, ACTION","229, 236, TRIGGER","110, 114, LOCATION"}

8334	2. The experiments carried out in duplicates meaning that independently applied sand filters were used, or the same filters were sued and two samples were taken, or one sample was taken and analysed twice? It should be clearly stated  in the manuscript.	{"242, 252, LOCATION","7, 44, CONTENT","209, 215, MODAL","218, 233, ACTION","227, 235, ACTION","209, 216, MODAL","206, 209, CONTENT","242, 252, LOCATION"}
8335	3. The introduction should mention sustainable efforts for wastewater treatment. Sand filters are one of the simplest, and possibly greenest, solutions. However, several processes and materials have been developed for sustainable wastewater treatment that should be summarised  in the introduction: Journal of Cleaner Production, 2016, 130, 103-115; Green Chem., 2015, 17, 5196-5205; Energy Environ. Sci., 2014, 7, 911-924.	{"153, 160, TRIGGER","20, 27, MODAL","162, 250, CONTENT","20, 26, MODAL","153, 160, TRIGGER","256, 263, MODAL","7, 20, LOCATION","266, 278, ACTION","27, 35, ACTION","285, 297, LOCATION","35, 79, CONTENT","299, 422, CONTENT","20, 34, ACTION","7, 19, LOCATION"}
8336	4. The data presented under section 3.2 is too dense and difficult to digest. The authors should provide more explanation to facilitate understanding  the data.	{"43, 52, ACTION","57, 76, ACTION","7, 21, CONTENT","28, 39, LOCATION","96, 149, ACTION","28, 39, LOCATION","90, 97, MODAL","97, 105, ACTION","105, 121, CONTENT"}

8338	6. The results and the discussion were split into two sections. These section should be better connected . The discussion section (4) should be linked  to the results section (3) via referring to the figures and panel in section 3. It would help to follow the discussions under section 4.	{"87, 104, ACTION","78, 84, MODAL","78, 85, MODAL","111, 133, LOCATION","88, 104, ACTION","183, 195, ACTION","200, 207, LOCATION","212, 217, LOCATION","7, 14, LOCATION","159, 178, LOCATION","278, 287, LOCATION","235, 241, MODAL","221, 230, LOCATION","144, 152, ACTION","134, 141, MODAL","23, 33, LOCATION","64, 77, LOCATION","23, 33, LOCATION"}
8339	7. The conclusion section should include the main research outcomes in quantitative statements.	{"26, 33, MODAL","33, 41, ACTION","7, 25, LOCATION","7, 17, LOCATION","45, 94, CONTENT","26, 40, ACTION"}
8340	The manuscript by Mattinen and co-workers details the preparation and application of lignin-based nanoparticles. The work is sufficiently detailed to be reproducible. The topic is timely and of interest to a broad audience. A significant amount of data is presented in the manuscript to support the claims. However, there are several issues that must be addressed  prior to publishing.	{"346, 350, MODAL","353, 363, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION","346, 351, MODAL","354, 365, ACTION","4, 15, LOCATION","307, 314, TRIGGER","326, 340, CONTENT","307, 314, TRIGGER"}
8341	1. The solvent volumes used (THF, water) under section 2.5 should be reported . Same applies to the other subsections of the methods section.	{"59, 65, MODAL","68, 77, ACTION","47, 58, LOCATION","47, 58, LOCATION","69, 78, ACTION","59, 66, MODAL","100, 117, LOCATION","125, 140, LOCATION","80, 92, TRIGGER","7, 40, CONTENT"}
8342	2. The figures showing the actual data should be provided  in high resolution. Currently some of the data are blurred and pixeled, e.g. Figure 1a.	{"79, 88, TRIGGER","59, 77, CONTENT","7, 38, LOCATION","39, 46, MODAL","49, 59, ACTION","89, 105, CONTENT","106, 117, ACTION","122, 129, ACTION","136, 145, LOCATION","7, 14, LOCATION","48, 57, ACTION","39, 45, MODAL"}
8343	3. Figure 1 should be divided  into at least two separate figures, and the panel designations should be placed  either at the top or the bottom of the figures but not in a random fashion.	{"151, 159, LOCATION","159, 162, TRIGGER","12, 18, MODAL","21, 29, ACTION","3, 11, LOCATION","119, 129, LOCATION","130, 132, TRIGGER","112, 118, TRIGGER","3, 11, LOCATION","12, 19, MODAL","133, 143, LOCATION","22, 31, ACTION","45, 65, CONTENT","94, 101, MODAL","104, 112, ACTION","75, 93, CONTENT"}
8344	4. The IUPAC-recommended x y^-1 format for units should be consistent throughout the manuscript (e.g. g/mol needs to be corrected in Figure 2 nJ/m, mN/m need to be corrected in Figure 4).	{"7, 38, CONTENT","142, 146, LOCATION","102, 107, LOCATION","49, 56, MODAL","108, 114, MODAL","133, 141, LOCATION","120, 130, ACTION","49, 55, MODAL","85, 95, LOCATION","153, 158, MODAL","164, 174, ACTION","177, 185, LOCATION","59, 70, ACTION","85, 96, LOCATION","148, 152, LOCATION"}
8345	5. The presented work centers on sustainable/green solutions. I short introductory paragraph should be added  on the topic with some recent and broad examples to demonstrate the importance and extensive interest in finding sustainable/green solutions (ChemSusChem, 2018, 11, 3640-3648; Green Chem., 2018, 20, 4911-4919; Green Chem., 2017, 19, 3116-3125; Green Chem., 2018, 20, 4901-4910; ACS Catal., 2018, 8, 7430-7438).	{"93, 100, MODAL","93, 99, MODAL","102, 108, ACTION","83, 92, LOCATION","64, 92, CONTENT","123, 127, TRIGGER","128, 158, CONTENT","178, 250, CONTENT","251, 419, CONTENT","162, 174, ACTION","103, 110, ACTION"}
8346	6. Closely related works on the use of lignin nanoparticles as adhesives should be acknowledged  (Biotechnol Biofuels., 2017, 10, 192.; The Journal of Adhesion, 2018, 94, 814-828; J. Appl.

8347	7. What is the accuracy for the PDI measurements? Values are reported down to 0.01 decimal places, which seems too much.	{"99, 105, TRIGGER","105, 119, ACTION","50, 97, CONTENT","3, 8, TRIGGER","3, 7, TRIGGER","8, 48, CONTENT"}
8348	8. The conclusions section should summarize the main research findings, and preferably it should include some quantitative statements. The drawbacks and limitations of the methods should also be mentioned to add a critical edge. On the contrary, the abstract section should contain less quantitative information and should read more general.	{"323, 328, ACTION","328, 340, CONTENT","316, 323, MODAL","282, 311, CONTENT","274, 282, ACTION","267, 274, MODAL","250, 266, LOCATION","139, 179, CONTENT","195, 205, ACTION","180, 187, MODAL","110, 133, CONTENT","97, 105, ACTION","90, 97, MODAL","48, 70, CONTENT","34, 44, ACTION","27, 34, MODAL","7, 26, LOCATION","250, 258, LOCATION","90, 104, ACTION","27, 33, MODAL"}
8349	The manuscript entitled „Association between vitamin D intake and bone mineral density in Koreans aged ?50 years: Analysis of the 2009 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey using a newly established vitamin D database” presents an interesting issue, but it requires some important revisions.	{"4, 14, LOCATION","267, 270, TRIGGER","24, 235, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","274, 283, ACTION","288, 307, CONTENT","267, 271, TRIGGER"}
8350	Most important is the fact, that the information about vitamin D intake are not accurate. One problem is associated with the fact, that assessment of the vitamin D intake on the basis of the 24-h recall is flawed (especially in the case of such nutrient as vitamin D that is obtained from the specific food products that are not consumed each day). Moreover, Authors present no information about the way in which 24-h recall was conducted, so reader receives almost no information about obtaining the most important data (vitamin D intake), that for the journal analyzing the intake of nutrients is crucial.	{"596, 606, ACTION","554, 595, CONTENT","191, 202, CONTENT","522, 538, CONTENT","37, 71, CONTENT","72, 88, ACTION","136, 170, CONTENT","367, 389, ACTION","413, 438, CONTENT","349, 357, TRIGGER","203, 212, ACTION","275, 315, CONTENT","349, 357, TRIGGER"}
8351	It seems that Authors are not native English speakers, as some sentences are hard to follow – I think that the article should be corrected  by a fluent English speaker.	{"77, 91, ACTION","58, 72, CONTENT","119, 126, MODAL","129, 140, ACTION","111, 118, LOCATION","119, 125, MODAL","128, 138, ACTION"}
8352	The references are shabbily prepared, as it seems, that the number of references in the text are not in agreement with numbers indicated in References section (e.g. line 98 –“in our previous study [12]”, while [12] is the WHO technical report).	{"119, 136, CONTENT","174, 202, LOCATION","97, 113, ACTION","165, 172, LOCATION","88, 92, LOCATION","88, 92, LOCATION","56, 80, CONTENT","204, 209, TRIGGER","222, 242, CONTENT","140, 158, LOCATION","19, 36, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION","210, 214, LOCATION"}

8354	The title is misleading, as the association between vitamin D intake and bone mineral density is just the minor element of the study, while a lot of other associations were rather analysed – it should be specified  in the title.	{"203, 213, ACTION","28, 188, CONTENT","194, 200, MODAL","218, 227, LOCATION","0, 9, LOCATION","4, 9, LOCATION","13, 23, ACTION","204, 213, ACTION","194, 200, MODAL"}

8356	Authors present excessive information about osteoporosis, but with not enough information about vitamin D intake. They should remove some information about osteoporosis that for the aim of the study are irrelevant. At the same time, they should indicate necessary data about fish products and dairy products intake in the Korean population.

8368	Authors should deeply reformulate their discussion, as the discussion should be closely associated  with the aim of the study. Authors should not discuss the other issues, that are not related to the aim of the study, e.g. aging associated with the reduction of BMD, glucose and insulin level in osteoporosis individuals, etc. Instead, they should discuss the aimed association and the role of specific food products. As the aim of their study they indicated associations between vitamin D intake and BMD, so the intake should be treated  as the major result, while currently it is treated as just a minor factor.	{"40, 50, LOCATION","8, 14, MODAL","88, 98, ACTION","530, 537, ACTION","539, 558, CONTENT","560, 565, TRIGGER","566, 612, CONTENT","40, 50, LOCATION","79, 98, ACTION","8, 14, MODAL","459, 504, CONTENT","327, 334, TRIGGER","509, 519, CONTENT","22, 34, ACTION","142, 153, ACTION","135, 141, MODAL","520, 526, MODAL","356, 416, CONTENT","347, 355, ACTION","341, 347, MODAL","154, 325, CONTENT","100, 125, CONTENT","59, 69, CONTENT","70, 76, MODAL"}

8370	Authors avoid indicating the specific conclusion from the conducted study. They did not specify the association between vitamin D intake and BMD neither at the end of the Discussion Section, nor in the Abstract “Vitamin D intake did not differ by BMD status; however, the lower the BMD, the lower was the vitamin D intake.” – it may seem to be contradictory after reading  only Abstract). The conclusion directly associated with the aim of the study should be specified .	{"450, 456, MODAL","332, 371, ACTION","38, 48, LOCATION","145, 153, TRIGGER","211, 323, LOCATION","153, 189, LOCATION","459, 469, ACTION","450, 456, MODAL","191, 195, TRIGGER","393, 403, LOCATION","404, 449, CONTENT","198, 210, LOCATION","80, 95, ACTION","259, 266, TRIGGER","96, 144, CONTENT"}
8371	It seems, that MK did nothing associated directly with the conducted study, statistical analysis and the manuscript preparing. For him“conceptualization” and“validation” is declared, but it is also controversial. What kind of“validation” did he do, if in the study no validation is presented? There is the risk of the Guest Authorship procedure, which is forbidden, so he should be removed from Authors or his contribution should be specified .	{"423, 429, MODAL","381, 389, ACTION","395, 402, LOCATION","369, 371, CONTENT","372, 378, MODAL","252, 291, CONTENT","218, 247, CONTENT","249, 251, TRIGGER","213, 217, TRIGGER","183, 186, TRIGGER","157, 169, LOCATION","134, 153, LOCATION","59, 125, CONTENT","18, 29, ACTION","433, 442, ACTION","406, 422, CONTENT","183, 186, TRIGGER","372, 378, MODAL","381, 442, ACTION","105, 115, LOCATION"}
8372	The manuscript by Pan et al. describes the preparation and performance of Ag/GO composites. The results are new and of interest to the readers of Nanomaterials. However, there are numerous technical and presentation issues which must be addressed  prior to further consideration for publication.	{"237, 248, ACTION","0, 14, LOCATION","161, 168, TRIGGER","161, 168, TRIGGER","96, 103, LOCATION","236, 246, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION","229, 233, MODAL","229, 233, MODAL","180, 222, CONTENT"}
8373	1) Avoid bulk references, e.g. line 35 refs [7-12]. Mention the most relevant works on individual basis.	{"2, 8, ACTION","39, 50, LOCATION","31, 38, LOCATION","52, 59, ACTION","60, 103, CONTENT","9, 24, CONTENT","31, 38, LOCATION"}
8374	2) How significant is the 11% and 48% enhancement in the electrical conductivity and the hardness? The enhancement should be linked  to the achievements in the literature, and to the application requirements.	{"115, 121, MODAL","133, 170, CONTENT","124, 131, ACTION","3, 6, TRIGGER","125, 131, ACTION","115, 121, MODAL","7, 97, CONTENT","99, 114, CONTENT","3, 6, TRIGGER","176, 207, CONTENT"}
8375	3) How can the agglomeration and non-uniform distribution of HQG in the composite above 1 wt% GO content be avoided? Evidence should be provided  for the agglomeration above 1 wt% and no agglomeration below.	{"146, 206, CONTENT","3, 10, TRIGGER","3, 6, TRIGGER","7, 10, MODAL","11, 115, CONTENT","135, 144, ACTION","126, 132, MODAL","136, 144, ACTION","117, 125, CONTENT"}
8376	4) The authors claim the development of a“simple, fast and highly efficient” technique. However, the actual methods used for the fabrication of the composite materials is not simple and requires significant energy. Therefore this statement should be carefully revised .	{"97, 167, CONTENT","88, 95, TRIGGER","240, 246, MODAL","249, 267, ACTION","41, 76, LOCATION","88, 95, TRIGGER","240, 246, MODAL","260, 267, ACTION","225, 239, LOCATION","41, 76, LOCATION","168, 181, ACTION"}
8377	5) Before embarking on the GO-containing metal matrix composites in line 36, the authors should briefly mention the GO-based composites in general with examples covering various applications such as sensors (http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/C8TA01923A), nanofiltration (http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b03591), adsorbents (http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma7086028) and fuel cells (http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/C8RA01731J).	{"104, 111, ACTION","112, 408, CONTENT","3, 9, LOCATION","10, 64, CONTENT","89, 95, MODAL","68, 75, LOCATION","89, 95, MODAL","68, 75, LOCATION"}
8378	6) Line 48-49 sentence needs a reference.	{"3, 13, LOCATION","3, 22, LOCATION","23, 28, ACTION","31, 40, CONTENT"}
8379	7) Following the recommendation of IUPAC, the x y-1 format should be followed  for all units in the manuscript (instead of the x/y).	{"42, 58, CONTENT","112, 130, CONTENT","69, 77, ACTION","59, 65, MODAL","100, 110, LOCATION","83, 110, LOCATION","59, 65, MODAL","68, 77, ACTION"}
8380	8) The authors prepared the HQG based on ref [20], their own work. If the procedure is exactly the same then the discussion on the preparation and characterisation of the HQG should be kept to a minimum in the current manuscript.	{"104, 108, TRIGGER","67, 69, TRIGGER","70, 103, CONTENT","41, 49, LOCATION","175, 181, MODAL","185, 189, ACTION","109, 174, CONTENT","190, 202, CONTENT","113, 123, LOCATION","218, 228, LOCATION","175, 181, MODAL"}
8381	9) The panels in Figure 2 should be provided  in a higher resolution stretching over the entire page-width. Currently it is impossible to see the fine details on the FTIR for instance.	{"26, 32, MODAL","36, 44, ACTION","3, 25, LOCATION","46, 106, CONTENT","124, 141, ACTION","17, 25, LOCATION","35, 44, ACTION","26, 32, MODAL","142, 158, CONTENT","159, 171, LOCATION"}

8383	11) The“%” in panel (a) and (b) of Figure 8 should be corrected  to“wt%”. Furthermore, the inset should be presented  as panel (c) as it is not legible in its current size.	{"107, 116, ACTION","4, 43, LOCATION","67, 72, CONTENT","118, 130, CONTENT","7, 10, LOCATION","44, 50, MODAL","87, 96, LOCATION","97, 103, MODAL","74, 85, TRIGGER","54, 63, ACTION","74, 85, TRIGGER","44, 53, MODAL","155, 171, CONTENT","53, 63, ACTION","134, 151, ACTION"}

8385	13) The authors should comment on the reproducibility of their composite materials and their performance. Currently there are no error bars reported. Were several batches of independently prepared materials tested?	{"129, 148, CONTENT","16, 22, MODAL","116, 128, ACTION","16, 22, MODAL","23, 30, ACTION","31, 104, CONTENT","150, 154, TRIGGER","155, 213, CONTENT"}

8388	16) Line 113: The FTIR and Raman do not give information about the“micro-structure” of the materials but their chemical functionality. Correct the text accordingly.	{"45, 100, CONTENT","33, 44, ACTION","14, 32, LOCATION","4, 12, LOCATION","135, 142, ACTION","142, 151, LOCATION","101, 104, TRIGGER","4, 12, LOCATION","101, 104, TRIGGER"}
8389	The manuscript by Kacprzy?ska-Go?acka and co-workers describes membrane surface modification with AgO by plasma treatment. The research is timely and of interest to a broad audience working on water treatment and membranes. Therefore the topic fits well within the scope of the journal Membranes. However, there are some minor and major points that must be addressed  prior to further consideration.	{"297, 304, TRIGGER","316, 343, CONTENT","0, 14, LOCATION","349, 353, MODAL","4, 14, LOCATION","356, 366, ACTION","349, 353, MODAL","297, 304, TRIGGER","357, 366, ACTION"}
8390	1) It is unnecessary to introduce abbreviations that are not used in the text. For instance EPS was introduced on page 1 and never used again.	{"73, 77, LOCATION","9, 33, ACTION","34, 65, CONTENT","66, 77, LOCATION","114, 120, LOCATION","92, 110, CONTENT"}
8391	2) The final paragraph of the introduction section should clearly state what the problems are with the current antifouling  methods and how the proposed research solves the problem (hypothesis).	{"3, 50, LOCATION","77, 131, CONTENT","72, 76, TRIGGER","57, 122, ACTION","13, 22, LOCATION","66, 71, ACTION","136, 139, TRIGGER","139, 193, CONTENT","72, 76, TRIGGER","51, 57, MODAL"}

8395	6) The photocatalytic activity among other results reported, does not have error bars. Were the experiments repeated on independently prepared membranes? Details about reproducibility should be reported .	{"61, 74, ACTION","184, 190, MODAL","50, 59, ACTION","3, 30, LOCATION","87, 91, TRIGGER","43, 59, LOCATION","75, 85, CONTENT","154, 183, CONTENT","184, 190, MODAL","194, 202, ACTION","91, 152, CONTENT"}

8401	The manuscript entitled“Adiposity mediates the association between the dietary inflammatory index and markers of type 2 diabetes risk in middle-aged black South African women” presents interesting issue, but it requires some corrections.	{"0, 15, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","204, 207, TRIGGER","204, 207, TRIGGER","23, 175, LOCATION","211, 219, ACTION","220, 236, CONTENT"}
8402	DII is not precisely described, but it seems that there are some coefficients for specific nutrients, however it is not specified how were they calculated (for which population). As a result, applied coefficients may not be possible to be applied in the assessed  population. It should be extensively described , as the section presenting DII is shabbily described.	{"102, 109, TRIGGER","116, 129, ACTION","0, 3, CONTENT","32, 35, TRIGGER","316, 342, LOCATION","346, 364, ACTION","7, 30, ACTION","301, 310, ACTION","279, 285, MODAL","32, 35, TRIGGER","213, 216, MODAL","223, 262, ACTION","130, 177, CONTENT"}
8403	Some parts of the manuscript are shabbily prepared – typos should be corrected  (e.g. doubled spaces in a number of sentences and others – as line 51) and manuscript should be prepared  according to the Instructions for Authors (e.g. leadings, tables)	{"176, 184, ACTION","155, 165, LOCATION","186, 251, CONTENT","33, 50, ACTION","166, 175, MODAL","0, 28, LOCATION","86, 100, CONTENT","69, 78, ACTION","142, 149, LOCATION","106, 136, LOCATION","18, 28, LOCATION","68, 78, ACTION","59, 65, MODAL","59, 65, MODAL","53, 58, CONTENT"}

8406	Authors applied a multiple references and for even a simple information they refer a number of references (for a number of sentences 4 references). As a result, they referred in this section 28 references, that are not needed, as a number of them reproduces the same information.

8414	Authors should reduce in this section“promotion” of their study, as some parts, being reproduced many times, seem rather as a commercial than a scientific discussion – e.g. line 349 and 427. The Discussion should be more balanced  and should not present emotional relation with the aim of the study.	{"15, 22, ACTION","235, 241, MODAL","216, 229, ACTION","206, 212, MODAL","25, 37, LOCATION","242, 253, ACTION","37, 48, LOCATION","8, 14, MODAL","254, 298, CONTENT","191, 205, LOCATION","215, 229, ACTION","173, 189, LOCATION","37, 63, CONTENT","8, 14, MODAL"}

8416	This section is very shabbily prepared and is not in accordance with the names of Authors – e.g. who is“TM”?	{"0, 12, LOCATION","21, 38, ACTION","103, 107, LOCATION","46, 68, ACTION","103, 107, LOCATION","97, 100, TRIGGER","68, 89, CONTENT"}
8417	Authors referred a number of their own studies (11 from among 48 – over 23% of all the references), that may be perceived  as an ethical issue, as sometimes they are only weakly associated with the aim of the study.	{"111, 121, ACTION","123, 142, CONTENT","19, 98, CONTENT","105, 121, ACTION","105, 108, MODAL"}
8419	2. Avoid exaggeration, e.g. line 11-12 -> the same sentence has‘facile’ and‘easy’; line 48 ->‘enormous attention’; line 135 ->‘dramatically enhanced’; line 193 ->‘superb’	{"151, 159, LOCATION","3, 21, ACTION","83, 90, LOCATION","28, 38, LOCATION","28, 38, LOCATION","93, 113, LOCATION","60, 63, ACTION","126, 149, LOCATION","63, 71, LOCATION","75, 81, LOCATION","162, 170, LOCATION","42, 59, LOCATION","115, 123, LOCATION"}

8422	5. The authors mention that graphene is a good adsorbent for metals and give some examples in the introduction. The versatile nature of graphene should be emphasized and examples for organic molecule adsorption by graphene should also be mentioned  (Green Chem., 2015, 17, 5196–5205; ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 2015, 7, 6690–6697).	{"230, 234, TRIGGER","238, 247, ACTION","154, 247, ACTION","170, 222, CONTENT","155, 165, ACTION","145, 151, MODAL","112, 144, CONTENT","98, 110, LOCATION","145, 151, MODAL","223, 229, MODAL","250, 331, CONTENT"}
8423	6. It is not clear what the matrix for the rutin analysis is. It seems that the authors used a single solute solution of rutin for their work, and then in section 3.6 applied the electrode using real samples. How does the real matrix affect the detection performance of the electrode developed? The reported linearity range and LOD are determined using a single solute solution or real samples? This should be mentioned  in the abstract and the conclusions as well.	{"19, 60, CONTENT","441, 456, LOCATION","421, 436, LOCATION","410, 421, ACTION","381, 393, CONTENT","378, 380, TRIGGER","209, 212, TRIGGER","155, 166, LOCATION","409, 419, ACTION","400, 406, MODAL","19, 23, TRIGGER","457, 464, TRIGGER","400, 406, MODAL","295, 377, CONTENT","213, 293, CONTENT","155, 166, LOCATION","9, 18, ACTION"}

8425	8. The linearity range for reported rutin sensors is between 0.4 nM and 500 µM. This range is very broad. The authors should comment on what the useful range is, in terms of applications. In other words, what is the actual concentration that needs to be measured in real samples?	{"118, 124, MODAL","136, 140, TRIGGER","136, 140, TRIGGER","141, 202, CONTENT","118, 124, MODAL","125, 132, ACTION","204, 208, TRIGGER","212, 278, CONTENT"}
8426	9. The detection method was optimised by changing one factor at a time, the pH was optimised, then the accumulation time etc. However, it should be mentioned  that the Design of Experiments approach could further enhance the optimisation process because the various factors can be studied  simultaneously revealing their interactions (J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal., 2016, 120, 297–305; Drug Test. Anal., 2014, 6 (9), 898–908).	{"335, 418, CONTENT","164, 333, CONTENT","126, 133, TRIGGER","147, 157, ACTION","138, 144, MODAL","148, 157, ACTION","126, 133, TRIGGER","17, 23, LOCATION","138, 144, MODAL"}
8427	10. The table comparing the current work with previously reported rutin sensors is incomplete and other works, especially based on graphene-enhanced electrodes should be mentioned  (RSC Adv., 2016, 6, 107851–107858; Analyst, 2016, 141, 5792–5798).	{"160, 166, MODAL","98, 159, CONTENT","182, 245, CONTENT","170, 181, ACTION","83, 93, ACTION","169, 179, ACTION","4, 13, LOCATION","160, 166, MODAL"}
8428	11. The conclusion section is more qualitative than quantitative. Some actual data (linearity range, LOD, LOQ, RSD, graphene-based performance enhancement etc.) should be included .	{"30, 46, CONTENT","47, 52, TRIGGER","52, 64, CONTENT","66, 160, CONTENT","170, 179, ACTION","161, 167, MODAL","161, 167, MODAL","171, 180, ACTION","4, 26, LOCATION","8, 18, LOCATION"}
8429	The manuscript entitled “Monitoring excreted gluten immunogenic peptides as a new tool to study protein metabolism and for the management of gluten intolerances” presents the interesting issue, but it requires some major corrections, including those associated with ethical issues.	{"210, 280, CONTENT","0, 14, LOCATION","24, 161, LOCATION","201, 210, ACTION","194, 197, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","194, 197, TRIGGER"}
8430	The serious flaw of the presented manuscript is associated with the fact, that it presents a highly subjective review, not a systematic review. While the systematic review has a key role in the evidence-based medicine, the other reviews don’t have such role. Taking into account, that the Materials and methods section is not presented, without any specific information, it is hard to understand which studies were included into review and why. In spite of the fact that Authors presented some key words (lines 90-93: “protein metabolism urine”, “protein detection urine”, “protein detection feces”, “gluten detection urine”, “gluten detection feces”, “follow-up celiac disease”, “gluten-free diet monitoring”, “gluten-free diet adherence”, “gluten-free diet children”, “gluten-free diet adolescent”, “refractory celiac disease”, “non-responsive celiac disease”), they did not indicate how was the search conducted (all key words combined? In pairs? Or any other option…). Moreover, they also indicated additional key words (lines 93-95: “gluten immunogenic peptides”, “celiac disease”; “gluten metabolism”; “gluten excretion”, “gluten peptides fate”), so reader has no idea how in fact was the search conducted.	{"600, 624, LOCATION","289, 319, LOCATION","886, 971, CONTENT","322, 335, ACTION","396, 401, TRIGGER","869, 885, ACTION","34, 44, LOCATION","396, 443, CONTENT","801, 828, LOCATION","680, 709, LOCATION","741, 768, LOCATION","1175, 1178, TRIGGER","770, 799, LOCATION","1187, 1211, CONTENT","1156, 1174, ACTION","1128, 1150, LOCATION","1087, 1106, LOCATION","1108, 1126, LOCATION","34, 44, LOCATION","4, 16, ACTION","93, 117, CONTENT","119, 142, ACTION","1069, 1085, LOCATION","505, 516, LOCATION","1038, 1067, LOCATION","1025, 1036, LOCATION","973, 981, TRIGGER","377, 395, ACTION","573, 598, LOCATION","711, 739, LOCATION","518, 544, LOCATION","830, 861, LOCATION","546, 571, LOCATION","626, 650, LOCATION","652, 678, LOCATION"}
8431	Moreover, Authors did not present any inclusion and exclusion criteria of references, number of chosen references, as well as information if some of them were excluded from the review and on the basis of which criteria. Flow chart is highly recommended to be presented.	{"204, 209, TRIGGER","18, 33, ACTION","259, 268, ACTION","220, 230, CONTENT","38, 218, CONTENT"}
8432	The abovementioned problem of the lack of specified inclusion/ exclusion criteria of the references to the review (resulting in the risk of dishonest choice of references) is becoming even more serious, as all the Authors have a important conflict of interest, as they all are employees of Biomedal SL, which offers the products which are described by Authors in their review. Authors applied very controversial procedure of presenting the detailed analysis that were conducted while using the products of their company (lines 296-301, 305-308, 319-321, Table 3). It may be perceived  as a serious ethical issue, as the constant emphasizing the role of their company and its products may be indicating as just advertising . Especially if Authors did not prepare research article, but a review, constant indicating minor methodological aspects, only to mention the company name does not present any information essential for the study. Authors applied not recommended procedure of referring not only published data, but also: Their manuscripts being in preparation (e.g. lines 108, 211, 322, 323) Unpublished data of their company (e.g. lines 308, 310-313)	{"1086, 1089, LOCATION","990, 998, TRIGGER","999, 1013, CONTENT","1015, 1023, TRIGGER","1025, 1063, CONTENT","877, 893, ACTION","894, 933, CONTENT","1096, 1129, CONTENT","521, 534, LOCATION","573, 583, ACTION","567, 570, MODAL","303, 308, TRIGGER","89, 99, LOCATION","398, 421, ACTION","521, 534, LOCATION","536, 543, LOCATION","545, 552, LOCATION","554, 561, LOCATION","567, 570, MODAL","574, 611, CONTENT","684, 687, MODAL","951, 976, CONTENT","1070, 1079, LOCATION","1081, 1084, LOCATION","1091, 1094, LOCATION","1136, 1145, LOCATION","1147, 1154, LOCATION"}
8433	Authors must be aware, that for the review article, the most important issue is the reliability of applied references, so they cannot base their manuscript on the data that are not available for other researchers/ readers of their manuscript, as is causes that their thesis are of a low credibility.	{"8, 12, MODAL","231, 241, LOCATION","107, 117, LOCATION","80, 95, CONTENT","71, 79, ACTION","127, 138, ACTION","163, 221, CONTENT","145, 155, LOCATION","283, 298, ACTION","145, 155, LOCATION"}

It should be either corrected or explained . The contributions of Authors should be presented  in Author Contributions section in details – the information that “all authors contributed” is not sufficient.

8436	The manuscript by Campañ and co-workers describes the preparation and application of PBI/MOF composite membranes. The work is novel and has a good potential impact. The work was carried out rigorously and a good amount of data is presented in the manuscript. The topic is of interest to the readers of Nanomaterials.

8507	The novel work by Shao et al. is of interest to a broader engineering community but the manuscript need to be improved prior to publication. The work is detailed enough to ensure understanding, the majority of the manuscript reads well and built in a logical manner. The introduction is too narrow and needs to discuss broader context for which recommendations have been given. Some calculations and presentation of the data need to be improved.	{"425, 430, MODAL","311, 319, ACTION","214, 224, LOCATION","110, 119, ACTION","99, 104, MODAL","271, 283, LOCATION","436, 444, ACTION","302, 308, MODAL","80, 83, TRIGGER","319, 376, CONTENT","378, 424, CONTENT","88, 98, LOCATION","80, 84, TRIGGER","84, 98, LOCATION"}

8509	2) A general introduction and recent examples to sustainable wastewater treatment should be provided  in the introduction in order to introduce the topic in its broad context. The trend is to develop materials and processes which are sustainable. Such trend and recent examples which aim to address the problems listed in lines 47-49 should be provided : hydrodynamic cavitational technique (Ultrason. Sonochem. 2002, 9(3), 123-131), molecular imprinting (Green Chem., 2015, 17, 5196-5205), and microbial fuel cells (Energy Environ.

8540	4) The results and discussion starts with the SEM results, however, there is no detailed information about the preparation of the samples being tested. The materials section should list all materials/chemicals/solvents used, their grade and their supplier. An individual section should be dedicated for the preparation of the LDPE materials tested . The material fabrication needs to be more detailed (reproducible) than what is currently included under the materials section (including equipment/apparatus).	{"156, 173, LOCATION","279, 286, MODAL","402, 414, ACTION","375, 381, MODAL","392, 400, ACTION","350, 374, CONTENT","7, 14, LOCATION","59, 66, TRIGGER","288, 347, ACTION","19, 29, LOCATION","487, 506, LOCATION","19, 29, LOCATION","458, 475, LOCATION","299, 347, CONTENT","289, 299, ACTION","257, 279, CONTENT","186, 255, CONTENT","181, 186, ACTION","174, 181, MODAL","59, 66, TRIGGER","174, 180, MODAL"}

8567	1. The abstract does not reveal specific information about the work. Vague expression such as‘the best mechanical and anti-swelling performance’ ,‘MIP adsorbed more than NIP’ should be avoided . Quantify the performance. How did the pH affect the efficiency?

8584	The title should be reformulated , as in the present form (“…the potential interface between diet, NO homeostasis and vasodilation, and performance?”) it is rather like a title for a column in the newspaper. Moreover, the title should not be declarative as it tends to overemphasize conclusions – it should not be formulated  as“The oral microbiome of elite athletes during intensified training is affected by dietary change”.

In the Materials and Methods section, Authors indicated 3 references for their classification, but in 2 of them, short sleepers are those who sleep less than 6 hours, that is in general more reasonable. The following categories are in referred studies: <6, 6-8, >8 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22951155), 5-6, 7-8 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25137304). Taking it into account, the referred studies do not justify the categories in the presented study. Moreover, the referred studies indicate the main weakness of the study – the fact, that in the“short sleepers” there were not only“real” short sleepers, but also typical sleepers. In my opinion, the results should be recalculated  to present the association for more reasonable categories, or at least the additional analysis should be conducted  for“real” short sleepers sub-category.	{"970, 1012, CONTENT","262, 291, LOCATION","931, 937, MODAL","941, 953, ACTION","919, 930, CONTENT","958, 965, ACTION","1030, 1049, CONTENT","1050, 1056, MODAL","1060, 1069, ACTION","1071, 1108, CONTENT","350, 353, TRIGGER","931, 937, MODAL","940, 953, ACTION","138, 148, LOCATION","673, 684, ACTION","128, 148, LOCATION","1014, 1016, TRIGGER","689, 723, CONTENT","724, 732, TRIGGER","201, 214, ACTION","153, 200, CONTENT","653, 669, CONTENT"}
8650	2.      The second very important problem is associated with the fact, that Authors indicated the need for“more studies to assess the relationship between sleep measures and FV intakes using validated detailed dietary assessment”, but the tools that they used were not validated (or they were validated, but the validation is not indicated). Due to a number of problems with the conducted analysis of intake (problems associated for materials and Methods section: the analysis not conducted during typical days, the day not representative for a week), it should be indicated , that the presented study does not solve the problem that was specified in the Introduction section, as it was not based on“validated detailed dietary assessment”. As there is no possibility to correct it now, in my opinion, it needs the extensive explanation and indicating it as a serious limitation of the study.	{"804, 809, ACTION","859, 890, CONTENT","677, 679, TRIGGER","565, 574, ACTION","555, 561, MODAL","810, 835, CONTENT","433, 462, LOCATION","326, 339, ACTION","312, 322, CONTENT","586, 601, LOCATION","239, 244, CONTENT","699, 738, CONTENT","740, 742, TRIGGER","260, 278, ACTION","607, 616, ACTION","231, 235, TRIGGER","617, 647, CONTENT","288, 302, ACTION","303, 307, TRIGGER","839, 850, ACTION","687, 696, ACTION","280, 282, TRIGGER","655, 675, LOCATION","83, 93, ACTION","106, 229, LOCATION","231, 234, TRIGGER","555, 561, MODAL"}
8651	The manuscript requires more careful editing, e.g. instead of“Uk”, there should be“UK”; the“FV” abbreviation is not needed –“fruit and vegetables” is the most important phrase in the manuscript, so it should not be replaced  by abbreviation; the spaces should be corrected  (e.g. line 58, 136, 320, 342, 351, 354, etc.), etc.	{"289, 292, LOCATION","73, 79, MODAL","299, 302, LOCATION","304, 307, LOCATION","112, 122, ACTION","246, 252, CONTENT","253, 259, MODAL","263, 272, ACTION","309, 312, LOCATION","294, 297, LOCATION","73, 79, MODAL","280, 287, LOCATION","214, 223, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION","82, 86, CONTENT","51, 61, TRIGGER","179, 193, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","37, 44, ACTION","201, 211, MODAL","228, 240, CONTENT","61, 65, LOCATION","91, 95, LOCATION","214, 223, LOCATION","124, 146, LOCATION"}

8674	3, The novelty of the work is not clear. Similar approaches have been reported, in particular by the authors.

8677	6, The introduction starts in medias res. The authors should set the context by briefly mentioning the horizon of nanocomposite membrane applications before narrowing  the discussion down to pervaporation (10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118007; 10.1039/D0TA05449F; 10.1021/acsapm.0c00432; 10.1039/C9GC00747D).	{"60, 166, ACTION","54, 60, MODAL","150, 156, TRIGGER","61, 64, ACTION","7, 19, LOCATION","103, 149, CONTENT","88, 98, ACTION","69, 76, CONTENT","7, 19, LOCATION","172, 299, CONTENT","157, 166, ACTION"}

8684	The manuscript details the fabrication and characterization of a novel coagulant (PATC) for the treatment of low turbidity water. This comprehensive study includes optimization of reaction conditions such as temperature, pH, elemental ratios, PATC initial dosage and settling time effects on removal of turbidity and morphology of flocculation. The experimental data is reinforced by an orthogonal simulation study with various combinations of reaction conditions. This study presents complementary experimental and theoretical findings encompassing the fields of engineering and purification, whilst tackling complex chemical processes; this manuscript is therefore well-suited to the scope of the journal Processes. Hence, the manuscript should be further considered to be published  after carefully addressing the comments below:	{"740, 746, MODAL","4, 14, LOCATION","740, 746, MODAL","149, 154, LOCATION","345, 366, LOCATION","470, 475, LOCATION","643, 653, LOCATION","718, 723, TRIGGER","725, 739, LOCATION","750, 768, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION","749, 784, ACTION"}
8685	1.       The quality and presentation of the figures throughout the manuscript need to be improved before publication.	{"13, 52, CONTENT","90, 98, ACTION","45, 52, LOCATION","53, 78, LOCATION"}
8686	·        The morphology of Al figures (Figures 3, 5, 7, 9) are slightly hard to read, with three different percentage scales on the same figure. These could be altered  to using only one y-axis or having the axes clearly labelled with percentages. This would make it easier for the reader to decipher the morphology distribution for different reaction conditions.	{"197, 203, ACTION","194, 196, TRIGGER","168, 193, CONTENT","207, 246, CONTENT","253, 258, MODAL","159, 167, ACTION","151, 156, MODAL","39, 57, LOCATION","27, 37, LOCATION","91, 143, CONTENT","30, 37, LOCATION","274, 362, CONTENT","151, 156, MODAL","259, 273, ACTION","160, 167, ACTION"}
8687	·        The FTIR spectra (Figure 10) is very grainy with small features, this makes it hard to read axis and wavenumber annotations. This image should be improved  in quality and, if possible, assign wavenumbers to important specific bond stretching vibrations on the figure e.g Al-O-Al, Si-O-Si, O-H.	{"145, 151, MODAL","201, 302, CONTENT","27, 36, LOCATION","168, 175, CONTENT","155, 163, ACTION","194, 200, ACTION","27, 36, LOCATION","145, 151, MODAL","154, 163, ACTION","13, 26, LOCATION","134, 144, LOCATION"}
8688	·        The XRD patterns (Figure 11, 12) are also grainy with numbers and text extremely difficult to determine. These features should be increased  in size to improve the figure before publication.	{"114, 128, CONTENT","27, 40, LOCATION","27, 36, LOCATION","138, 148, ACTION","129, 135, MODAL","173, 179, CONTENT","139, 148, ACTION","161, 168, ACTION","13, 26, LOCATION","129, 136, MODAL","153, 157, CONTENT"}
8689	·        The SEM images (Figure 13) are also poorly presented. The letter assignment of the image (a), (b) sometimes overlaps with the image itself and as with previous images, the text and numbers in (b) and (d) are hard to read. The presentation of important images such as these needs to be re-structured before publication.	{"45, 61, ACTION","294, 307, ACTION","25, 34, LOCATION","235, 267, CONTENT","25, 34, LOCATION","117, 147, CONTENT","67, 106, CONTENT","107, 116, TRIGGER","13, 23, LOCATION","152, 154, TRIGGER","160, 229, CONTENT"}

8691	2.       The presenting of data in table form could also be improved throughout the manuscript; tables should be well-structured, concise and easy for the reader to follow.	{"46, 51, MODAL","113, 128, ACTION","84, 94, LOCATION","96, 102, LOCATION","46, 51, MODAL","60, 68, ACTION","9, 45, CONTENT","130, 137, ACTION","103, 109, MODAL","80, 94, LOCATION"}
8692	·        Table 3, which documents the orthogonal test results, presents lots of information, some of which is hard to follow. There consist 25 separate entries in the table, of which it is hard for the reader to establish a trend. To make the table more information rich, it should perhaps only include selected entries with a high removal rate of turbidity. The rest of the test results could be moved  to a Supporting information section. This would make it easier for the reader to view which parameters resulted in the best removal of turbidity.	{"397, 402, ACTION","275, 281, MODAL","18, 23, TRIGGER","388, 393, MODAL","9, 16, LOCATION","409, 439, LOCATION","275, 281, MODAL","295, 302, ACTION","303, 357, CONTENT","359, 387, CONTENT","163, 172, LOCATION","9, 16, LOCATION","396, 402, ACTION"}
8693	·        The representation of table entries e.g A2B5D2E5 should also be specified. It is likely that these correspond to the initial letter and number assignments given in Table 1, however if this is the case it should be specified before or mentioned  in reference to Table 3. This would allow for the reader to refer back to Table 1 as a point of reference for the experiment parameters.	{"9, 44, CONTENT","328, 335, LOCATION","58, 64, MODAL","243, 252, ACTION","222, 252, ACTION","58, 64, MODAL","182, 189, TRIGGER","253, 266, CONTENT","73, 82, ACTION","173, 180, LOCATION","270, 277, LOCATION","173, 180, LOCATION","213, 219, MODAL","223, 232, ACTION","49, 57, CONTENT","182, 189, TRIGGER","240, 242, TRIGGER"}
8694	3.       At the end of the Introduction section, the author should emphasise the novelty of the study. For example, this study presents for the first time the preparation process of polyaluminum titanium silicate chloride and its flocculation performance. This allows the reader to distinguish this work from other similar studies i.e polyaluminum titanium silicate sulfate coagulant as prepared by Chang et al.	{"60, 66, MODAL","81, 101, CONTENT","12, 47, LOCATION","116, 255, CONTENT","60, 66, MODAL","67, 76, ACTION"}
8695	4.       In the results or conclusion section, the author(s) could include a small table or paragraph comparing  the turbidity removal of PATC to similar coagulants (e.g. by Chang et al.) and some commercially available aluminium coagulants e.g The minimum turbidity of 0.44 NTU for PATC is comparable to that of the coagulant prepared by Chang et al. (0.36 NTU).

8696	5.       The trend toward sustainable water treatment processes should be briefly mentioned in the introduction and backed  up with some recent process examples: Green Chem. 2015, 17, 5196-5205 and J.

8699	8.       Page 4, Line 155 A reference should be provided  for the statement: Temperature can affect the hydrolysis of metal salts, and extremely high or excessively low temperatures are not conducive to the preparation of efficient coagulants.	{"38, 44, MODAL","38, 44, MODAL","47, 56, ACTION","9, 15, LOCATION","9, 15, LOCATION","17, 25, LOCATION","48, 57, ACTION","28, 37, CONTENT","77, 243, CONTENT"}
8700	9.       Page 6, Line 202. The sentence‘This phenomenon can be explained  as n(Ti)/n(Al) ratio increasing; that is, the content of Ti (IV) in the coagulant increased relatively, the content of Al (III) decreased naturally, and a competitive relationship formed between the hydrolysis of Ti (IV) and Al(III)’ should be re-structured before publication.	{"62, 72, ACTION","56, 59, MODAL","9, 15, LOCATION","40, 306, CONTENT","318, 331, ACTION","308, 314, MODAL","17, 25, LOCATION","9, 15, LOCATION"}

8704	The manuscript by Elrasheedy and co-workers reviews the field of MOF-based MMMs for water treatment. The literature is worthwhile to be summarized in this context. The content of the manuscript fits well in the scope of the journal. However, there are several issues that must be addressed  before publishing the work. The main criticism is the fact that the review needs to be more than a simple compilation of literature. The detailed comments to improve the manuscript are given below.	{"279, 289, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION","164, 193, LOCATION","272, 276, MODAL","233, 240, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","280, 289, ACTION","323, 422, CONTENT","272, 276, MODAL","252, 266, CONTENT","233, 240, TRIGGER"}
8705	1. The authors should provide some future perspective on the field of MOF-MMM. What’s next? What are the current challenges of the field that needs to be addressed? What are the potential solutions to explore?	{"165, 169, TRIGGER","92, 96, TRIGGER","35, 77, CONTENT","79, 83, TRIGGER","15, 21, MODAL","79, 84, TRIGGER","15, 21, MODAL","22, 29, ACTION","174, 208, CONTENT","101, 163, CONTENT"}
8706	2. It is necessary to provide a comprehensive table that compares the MOF-MMMs for aqueous applications. MOFs, polymer matrix, loadings, performance etc should be compared .	{"153, 159, MODAL","162, 171, ACTION","22, 29, ACTION","32, 103, CONTENT","153, 159, MODAL","163, 171, ACTION","105, 148, CONTENT"}
8707	3. The different membrane preparation techniques for MOF-MMMs should be summarized and compared . A figure with several panels that show schematics of these techniques should be included  in the manuscript.	{"195, 205, LOCATION","3, 61, CONTENT","168, 174, MODAL","178, 186, ACTION","98, 167, CONTENT","62, 68, MODAL","71, 95, ACTION","62, 68, MODAL","72, 82, ACTION","87, 95, ACTION","195, 205, LOCATION"}
8708	4. The following MOF-MMM for water applications are missing from the review and should be discussed  (DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5b02276; 10.1039/C7TA00339K; 10.1021/acs.cgd.6b01398; 10.1021/acsanm.8b01902; 10.1021/acsanm.8b00501; 10.1038/srep03740; 10.1016/j.memsci.2019.02.020).	{"52, 59, ACTION","69, 75, LOCATION","3, 47, CONTENT","80, 87, MODAL","90, 99, ACTION","89, 99, ACTION","102, 269, CONTENT","80, 86, MODAL"}
8709	5. The manuscript lists most of the articles that fall within the scope but lacks critical assessment. The authors should add some critical comments as appropriate throughout the manuscript.	{"7, 17, LOCATION","115, 121, MODAL","115, 125, ACTION","122, 125, ACTION","72, 75, TRIGGER","72, 75, TRIGGER","7, 17, LOCATION","131, 148, CONTENT","179, 189, LOCATION"}
8710	6. What are the main limitations of MOFs as fillers for MMMs? In depth discussions should be included  in the manuscript. Stability issues and loss of performance as well as need for long-term performance studies should be mentioned .	{"110, 120, LOCATION","16, 60, CONTENT","3, 7, TRIGGER","223, 232, ACTION","110, 120, LOCATION","83, 89, MODAL","93, 101, ACTION","62, 82, CONTENT","122, 212, CONTENT","213, 219, MODAL","92, 101, ACTION","83, 89, MODAL","3, 7, TRIGGER"}
8711	7. Group large number of references should be avoided . These do not provide any useful information for the readers, e.g. [41-50].	{"45, 53, ACTION","36, 42, MODAL","3, 35, CONTENT","36, 42, MODAL","46, 53, ACTION","122, 129, LOCATION"}
8712	9. The figures taken from the literature are of low resolution. The authors should either redraw them or source a higher resolution image.	{"102, 104, TRIGGER","83, 90, TRIGGER","114, 137, CONTENT","6, 40, CONTENT","76, 82, MODAL","97, 101, CONTENT","7, 14, LOCATION","90, 96, ACTION","76, 82, MODAL","105, 111, ACTION"}
8713	10. The manuscript focuses on water application of MOFs. However, the authors should briefly mention in a sentence the potential and challenges of MOFs for non-aqueous MMMs and give some examples (DOI: 10.1039/C4TA00628C; 10.1039/C5RA10259F; 10.1016/j.memsci.2016.01.024).	{"78, 84, MODAL","78, 84, MODAL","93, 100, ACTION","119, 271, CONTENT","8, 18, LOCATION","57, 64, TRIGGER","8, 18, LOCATION","57, 64, TRIGGER"}
8714	11. The fabrication of green and sustainable membranes are becoming increasingly important. What is the potential of MOF-MMMs in that perspective? Are there any green MOFs? Have they been applied in any green process? These considerations should be added  to the review.	{"263, 269, LOCATION","161, 171, CONTENT","92, 96, TRIGGER","239, 245, MODAL","100, 145, CONTENT","173, 178, TRIGGER","146, 150, TRIGGER","249, 254, ACTION","248, 254, ACTION","239, 245, MODAL","92, 96, TRIGGER","218, 238, CONTENT","178, 216, CONTENT"}
8715	12. The conclusion section is vague. More tangible information that guide the readers on structure-function-performance relationship should be provided . The most promising MOFs for aqueous applications should also be highlighted here.	{"154, 203, CONTENT","142, 151, ACTION","8, 18, LOCATION","37, 132, CONTENT","133, 139, MODAL","143, 151, ACTION","133, 139, MODAL","218, 229, ACTION","203, 209, MODAL","8, 26, LOCATION","230, 234, LOCATION","210, 214, TRIGGER"}
8716	The manuscript entitled“Protective Effects of Moderate Ca Supplementation Against Cd-induced Bone Damage under Different Population-relevant Doses in Young Female Rats” presents interesting issue, but it requires some corrections before being published.	{"197, 200, TRIGGER","23, 168, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","212, 229, CONTENT","4, 14, LOCATION","197, 200, TRIGGER","204, 212, ACTION"}
8717	Authors should avoid personal descriptions (e.g.“we demonstrated”,“our findings”) and instead use less personal phrases (e.g.“it was demonstrated”,“the findings”).	{"98, 162, CONTENT","8, 20, ACTION","7, 14, MODAL","48, 65, LOCATION","15, 20, ACTION","94, 97, ACTION","86, 93, TRIGGER","21, 42, CONTENT","66, 80, LOCATION","48, 65, LOCATION"}
8718	The study requires precise justification in the Abstract which should prove that such study is needed. Authors failed to present such justification, as their Abstract indicated (lines 11-12) that everything is known and the studied effect is already proven.	{"158, 166, LOCATION","10, 18, ACTION","19, 40, CONTENT","57, 62, TRIGGER","81, 101, CONTENT","4, 9, LOCATION","57, 62, TRIGGER","70, 75, ACTION","48, 56, LOCATION","178, 189, LOCATION","63, 69, MODAL","63, 69, MODAL","48, 56, LOCATION"}
8719	More details associated with materials and methods are needed (e.g. number of studied animals, what precisely was done), as presented information are insufficient “Two 90-day oral toxicity study were conducted.” and nothing more).	{"163, 211, LOCATION","95, 99, TRIGGER","63, 118, CONTENT","55, 61, ACTION","0, 12, CONTENT","29, 50, LOCATION","163, 211, LOCATION"}

8721	The presented information need appropriate references, as the number of them is now presented with no references at all (e.g. lines 28-34 – one reference in line 34, but in this specific reference the information presented in lines 28-34 are not indicated – e.g. 10-35 years of Cd half-life)	{"126, 137, LOCATION","173, 222, CONTENT","166, 169, TRIGGER","126, 137, LOCATION","226, 237, LOCATION","31, 53, CONTENT","26, 30, ACTION","140, 153, CONTENT","242, 255, ACTION","263, 290, CONTENT","166, 169, TRIGGER","4, 25, LOCATION","157, 164, LOCATION"}
8722	The sentences presented one after another should be associated , as in the present form some paragraphs seem just as randomly collected sentences (e.g. sentence in lines 34-36 that is not associated with the previous part of the paragraph at all).	{"88, 145, CONTENT","152, 160, CONTENT","65, 67, TRIGGER","51, 62, ACTION","42, 48, MODAL","42, 48, MODAL","51, 62, ACTION","4, 12, LOCATION","71, 87, LOCATION","164, 175, LOCATION","0, 41, CONTENT"}

8780	The manuscript by Alguacil details the application of carbon nanotubes for gold recovery. The topic fits well the scope of the journal. The results are new and of interest to the readership of the journal. The manuscript is easy to digest and most of the claims are supported by data. However, there are multiple issues that must be addressed  prior to further consideration by Applied Science.	{"4, 14, LOCATION","325, 329, MODAL","136, 147, LOCATION","206, 220, LOCATION","285, 292, TRIGGER","332, 342, ACTION","325, 329, MODAL","285, 292, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","304, 319, CONTENT","333, 342, ACTION"}
8781	1. Bulk referencing should be avoided , e.g. the group of [2-26] is exhaustive and unnecessary. Discuss a few examples on individual basis rather than giving extensive groups of references that cannot be digested  by the readers.	{"45, 94, CONTENT","158, 188, CONTENT","151, 157, ACTION","139, 150, TRIGGER","30, 37, ACTION","20, 26, MODAL","2, 19, CONTENT","29, 37, ACTION","106, 138, CONTENT","96, 103, ACTION","20, 27, MODAL"}
8782	2. What are the prerequisites for gold adsorption carbon nanotubes? This should be discussed  in relation to the design of the experimental work, and any previous work closely related to the topic should be discussed  (Chem. Eng. Sci. 2014, 107, 58-65) around line 233.	{"97, 252, CONTENT","82, 92, ACTION","83, 94, ACTION","73, 79, MODAL","16, 66, CONTENT","260, 268, LOCATION","260, 268, LOCATION","73, 79, MODAL","3, 7, TRIGGER","3, 7, TRIGGER"}
8783	3. The author should comment on the reproducibility of the experiments and provide standard deviations / error bars for the results.

8784	4. The author did not demonstrate any reuse of the carbon nanotubes. Are these materials stable under strong acidic conditions? Gold recovery of 65% was achieved in the work. What happened with the rest of the gold? Can it be recovered or is it permanently adsorbed? Would the gold remaining  on the carbon nanotube decrease its adsorption capacity? How will this affect the performance and reuse of the adsorbent?	{"72, 126, CONTENT","69, 72, TRIGGER","175, 179, TRIGGER","272, 291, ACTION","216, 219, MODAL","194, 214, CONTENT","364, 413, CONTENT","350, 353, TRIGGER","277, 348, CONTENT","267, 272, MODAL","239, 265, CONTENT","236, 238, TRIGGER","216, 235, CONTENT","175, 179, TRIGGER"}
8785	5. The importance of elution from adsorbents was highlighted by the author, and examples of neglecting the development of elution were exemplified with 5 references. However, examples of literature detailing the importance of developing appropriate elution methods for adsorbents and guidelines on elution should also be mentioned here (Polym.

8792	The manuscript by Han et al. describes the preparation, characterization and application of a GO-MOF composite. The approach is new, the results are promising, the topic fits well the scope of the journal, the research is timely. The quality and presentation of results is good. However, there are several points to be addressed prior to acceptance for publishing the manuscript.	{"279, 286, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","319, 328, ACTION","298, 312, CONTENT","4, 14, LOCATION","279, 286, TRIGGER"}

8794	2. The authors refer to the GO-MIL composite and solvent as a solution, which would imply that the composite is soluble.

8795	3. Under the section 2.4 the authors mention the concentrations but without naming the solute. The concentration should always be followed by the solute it refers to.

8796	4. What was the rationale for the selection of the concentrations? It should be clarified  in the manuscript.

8797	5. The authors provided a good introduction to the adsorption of U. However, in a single sentence the various applications of GO and MOF should be also exemplified  to stress their versatility, and examples should include catalysis (Green Chem., 2017, 19, 1999-2005; ACS Catal., 2018, 8, 1417-1426), adsorbents (Chem, 2018, 4, 94-105; Chem. Eng. J., 2018, 349, 791-799), and membranes (J. Membr. Sci. 2016, 503, 166-176; ACS Appl. Mater.

8804	General: In the manuscript it should be emphasized , that the presented study is just theoretical one – the obtained food products list was not transferred into food frequency questionnaire and not validated in a group of patients. It should be indicated as the limitation of the study and future area of studies should be defined . The broaden limitations section is essential. It should be indicated  not only, that conducted study is just the theoretical analysis, but also the issue of age should be discussed . In the Introduction section, Authors indicated, that “dietary intakes are influenced by age, sex…” and afterwards they tried to design the gender-specific food items list, but in the analysis of individuals of various age groups combined. Authors totally ignored the problem of age group and analysed the age group of 19-64 years old individuals combined. We can agree, that the issue of gender is important and we should design gender-specific-age-specific FFQs, but not that we will start ignoring  the age and will design only gender-specific FFQs.	{"938, 944, ACTION","392, 402, ACTION","30, 36, MODAL","30, 36, MODAL","16, 26, LOCATION","382, 388, MODAL","323, 330, ACTION","337, 364, CONTENT","468, 471, TRIGGER","39, 50, ACTION","312, 320, MODAL","290, 312, CONTENT","262, 286, CONTENT","245, 254, ACTION","235, 241, MODAL","40, 50, ACTION","523, 543, LOCATION","930, 937, MODAL","699, 753, CONTENT","783, 803, CONTENT","808, 816, ACTION","984, 1066, CONTENT","895, 924, CONTENT","945, 978, CONTENT","980, 983, TRIGGER","821, 870, CONTENT","16, 26, LOCATION","62, 101, CONTENT","108, 135, CONTENT","135, 139, TRIGGER","140, 155, ACTION","156, 189, CONTENT","194, 207, ACTION","213, 230, CONTENT","403, 411, TRIGGER","418, 466, CONTENT","468, 476, TRIGGER","481, 493, CONTENT","494, 500, MODAL","504, 513, ACTION","553, 562, ACTION","569, 614, LOCATION","619, 629, TRIGGER","644, 650, ACTION","655, 686, CONTENT","688, 692, TRIGGER","771, 778, ACTION"}
8805	Title: The term“candidate foods” is defined in the Introduction section (line 58-59), but before it is used (Title, Abstract). In my opinion, the Title should be reformulated , to avoid using such terms which may not be easily understood by readers, to access the higher readability of the article.	{"109, 114, LOCATION","86, 89, TRIGGER","73, 83, LOCATION","51, 71, LOCATION","15, 32, LOCATION","0, 5, LOCATION","192, 248, CONTENT","180, 185, ACTION","116, 124, LOCATION","152, 158, MODAL","86, 89, TRIGGER","152, 158, MODAL","161, 174, ACTION","15, 32, LOCATION","162, 175, ACTION","146, 151, LOCATION"}
8806	Editing: Authors should also try to specify their considerations in more understandable way (e.g. line 218). The article should be also corrected  by native English speaker – as in the case of some paragraphs the sentences are hard to follow, it may result from the lack of such language editing .	{"17, 23, MODAL","136, 146, ACTION","121, 127, MODAL","98, 106, LOCATION","50, 91, CONTENT","36, 43, ACTION","17, 23, MODAL","109, 120, LOCATION","150, 172, CONTENT","98, 106, LOCATION","130, 145, ACTION"}
8807	Introduction: While Authors are indicating the role of“sex and gender” (line 45) it should be indicated why both factors are mentioned  – do Authors indicate both in the aspect of transgender individuals? If so, it should be also indicated if they found such FFQs which have the food products list dedicated  for such individuals?	{"229, 239, ACTION","264, 269, TRIGGER","54, 70, LOCATION","84, 90, MODAL","54, 70, LOCATION","104, 107, TRIGGER","108, 134, CONTENT","72, 79, LOCATION","93, 134, ACTION","84, 90, MODAL","93, 103, ACTION","204, 207, TRIGGER","215, 221, MODAL","240, 242, TRIGGER","14, 19, TRIGGER","0, 12, LOCATION","138, 203, CONTENT","259, 329, CONTENT","248, 253, ACTION"}
8808	Materials and methods: There is a number of repetitions – the same information are presented both in the text and in Figure 1 (selection of food products), or Table 2 (categories). While categories are presented in the text (lines 123-129), the number of them seems to be higher (28), than it is (25) because while comas are used between categories, the division is not clearly specified (e.g.“legumes, nuts and seeds” seems to be 2 categories –“legumes”,“nuts and seeds”). The excessive examples are redundant – lines 90-97. The household income should be presented  in more universal currency – e.g. USD. The analysed nutrients should be indicated  in the Materials and methods section.	{"0, 21, LOCATION","117, 125, LOCATION","105, 109, LOCATION","83, 92, ACTION","34, 78, CONTENT","127, 153, CONTENT","513, 524, LOCATION","501, 510, ACTION","478, 496, CONTENT","445, 471, CONTENT","393, 418, LOCATION","225, 238, LOCATION","219, 223, LOCATION","181, 186, TRIGGER","168, 178, CONTENT","159, 167, LOCATION","630, 636, MODAL","105, 109, LOCATION","82, 92, ACTION","547, 553, MODAL","658, 687, LOCATION","640, 649, ACTION","611, 629, CONTENT","571, 605, CONTENT","557, 566, ACTION","547, 553, MODAL","366, 388, ACTION","350, 362, CONTENT","530, 546, CONTENT"}
8809	Statistical analysis: Authors did not mention about verifying the normality of distribution and they chosen statistical test, that analyze differences between mean values (should be applied if parametric distribution is observed ), but not between medians (should be applied if nonparametric distribution is observed ). Moreover, in case of parametric distribution mean ± SD should be presented , while for nonparametric distribution – median accompanied by minimum and maximum value. The data presented in the tables (especially Table 3) indicate, that in some cases distribution was nonparametric. Please correct it. Authors should consider including  more specific pair test applied in the case of validation (comparison of distribution into quartiles, kappa test, Bland-Altman plot, etc.) – while they just compared means, they don’t observe the real differences between intakes obtained for the same respondents using 2 various food products list.	{"257, 263, MODAL","607, 614, ACTION","236, 255, CONTENT","193, 229, CONTENT","385, 394, ACTION","375, 382, MODAL","172, 178, MODAL","330, 374, CONTENT","190, 192, TRIGGER","568, 598, CONTENT","489, 517, CONTENT","530, 537, LOCATION","407, 483, CONTENT","659, 792, CONTENT","643, 652, ACTION","278, 317, CONTENT","182, 189, ACTION","275, 278, TRIGGER","511, 517, LOCATION","181, 228, ACTION","172, 178, MODAL","85, 88, TRIGGER","34, 45, ACTION","627, 633, MODAL","267, 275, ACTION","52, 91, CONTENT","832, 845, ACTION","820, 825, CONTENT","811, 819, ACTION","795, 800, TRIGGER","397, 402, TRIGGER","320, 328, TRIGGER","232, 235, TRIGGER","108, 170, CONTENT","101, 108, ACTION","850, 951, CONTENT"}
8810	Results: Information about“data not shown” should be excluded  – Authors should either show the data, or remove their description.

8813	Authors should present the most essential issues, while Authors failed to do it – they added Zn and Se, but they assessed the bioavailability of Zn, Se and Fe (they indicate that they assessed Zn and Se); they added not only hydroxytyrosol, but also other components. It must be specific.	{"8, 14, MODAL","104, 107, TRIGGER","15, 22, ACTION","271, 275, MODAL","8, 22, ACTION","87, 92, ACTION","50, 55, TRIGGER","27, 48, CONTENT","210, 215, ACTION","276, 287, ACTION","250, 266, CONTENT","241, 249, TRIGGER","126, 158, CONTENT","113, 121, ACTION","104, 107, TRIGGER","93, 102, CONTENT","193, 202, CONTENT","184, 192, ACTION","225, 239, CONTENT"}
8814	Abbreviations that are applied must be easier to follow – Authors not only indicate a number of abbreviations in the abstract, that are not applied in the abstract any more, but also some of them are applied twice to abbreviate various words (e.g.“C” – lines 14 and 18).	{"183, 195, CONTENT","174, 182, TRIGGER","117, 125, LOCATION","86, 109, CONTENT","66, 83, ACTION","36, 55, ACTION","0, 13, CONTENT","200, 213, ACTION","117, 125, LOCATION","247, 250, LOCATION","253, 268, LOCATION","31, 35, MODAL","31, 35, MODAL","174, 177, TRIGGER"}

8816	The section is excessive and should be reduced , especially if a number of paragraphs is not associated directly with the aim of the study. Instead Authors should present the current directions for the functional food meat products market with the information about bioavailability of the added nutrients. It must be prepared  for the readers of Nutrients journal, taking into account the scope of journal.	{"156, 162, MODAL","163, 170, ACTION","0, 11, LOCATION","175, 304, CONTENT","38, 46, ACTION","29, 35, MODAL","29, 35, MODAL","317, 325, ACTION","309, 313, MODAL","39, 46, ACTION","89, 103, ACTION","60, 62, TRIGGER","140, 147, TRIGGER","121, 138, CONTENT","65, 85, CONTENT"}

8825	In spite of the fact, that Authors fed 500 animals, they assessed only 4 of them (2 animals for each experimental group) – it is the great limitation of the presented study, causing that the obtained results are not representative for the population. Authors should indicate how they calculated the number of animals, number of batches, number of samples and number of repetitions – in the meat studies (due to a huge heterogeneity of material) it is necessary.	{"435, 443, LOCATION","259, 265, MODAL","275, 278, TRIGGER","266, 274, ACTION","259, 265, MODAL","299, 444, CONTENT","275, 278, TRIGGER","284, 294, ACTION"}

8833	The manuscript by Deliyanni and co-workers details the degradation of a dye using a nanocomposite material. The topic is timely, and contributes to the important topic of wastewater treatment. The manuscript is of interest to a broad audience, and fits well the scope of the journal. However, the introduction is weak and there are several technical ambiguities, incorrect data presentation, lack of details that must be corrected  prior to further consideration by Processes.	{"4, 14, LOCATION","284, 291, TRIGGER","297, 309, LOCATION","284, 291, TRIGGER","421, 430, ACTION","413, 417, MODAL","322, 407, CONTENT","4, 14, LOCATION","420, 430, ACTION","413, 417, MODAL"}
8834	1) The porosity of the nanocomposite should be further explored and explained . How does the GO affect the porosity, and how does this change affect the performance?	{"37, 43, MODAL","3, 36, CONTENT","80, 83, TRIGGER","68, 77, ACTION","37, 44, MODAL","46, 77, ACTION","80, 83, TRIGGER","130, 164, CONTENT","121, 124, TRIGGER","93, 115, CONTENT","55, 63, ACTION"}

8836	3) The rationale for the selection of RB5 for the presented study should be explained  in the text. What was the basis for the selectin of the concentration range?

8837	4) The removal % is meaningless. Instead, the results should be presented  as g/g as gram of degraded dye per gram of catalyst. The loading concentrations (volume and dye concentration) should also be reported in the figure caption.	{"33, 40, TRIGGER","64, 73, ACTION","54, 60, MODAL","42, 53, CONTENT","217, 231, LOCATION","201, 209, ACTION","54, 60, MODAL","186, 192, MODAL","128, 185, CONTENT","63, 73, ACTION","75, 126, CONTENT"}

8839	6) Give a short introduction to GO materials. The authors should briefly mention and provide examples for the diverse applicability of GO nanocomposites (batteries DOI:10.1039/C8TA08214F; electrodialysis DOI:10.1039/C8TA09160A; nanofiltration DOI:10.1021/acsami.8b03591; imaging DOI:10.1039/C8GC02106F).	{"93, 303, CONTENT","3, 7, ACTION","73, 80, ACTION","58, 64, MODAL","58, 64, MODAL","85, 92, ACTION","10, 44, CONTENT","16, 28, LOCATION"}

8841	8) The results section has an extensive amount of citations, which is confusing. It is unclear what are the observations made by the authors for the first time, and what had been reported in the literature previously. The authors should focus on their original findings under the results section.	{"230, 236, MODAL","61, 66, TRIGGER","7, 22, LOCATION","87, 94, ACTION","230, 236, MODAL","237, 242, ACTION","243, 269, CONTENT","280, 295, LOCATION","108, 159, CONTENT","174, 216, CONTENT","165, 169, TRIGGER","61, 66, TRIGGER","95, 99, TRIGGER"}
8842	9) A scale bar needs to be added on Figure 2a.

8845	12) The data in Figure 3b is not visible. More importantly the color scheme of the legend and the actual colors for the curves are different and therefore the figure cannot be interpreted .	{"176, 187, ACTION","175, 187, ACTION","166, 172, MODAL","3, 12, CONTENT","29, 40, ACTION","166, 172, MODAL","16, 25, LOCATION","16, 25, LOCATION","145, 154, TRIGGER","127, 140, ACTION","98, 126, CONTENT","159, 165, CONTENT","63, 89, CONTENT"}
8846	13) Reproducibility of the experiments need to be explained. Standard deviations should be reported  (Table 1, Figure 5). Derivation of errors should be mentioned  in the text.

8849	The manuscript by Sapkota and coworkers is a well-written work that is of interest to the readers of the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health. The work is novel, the descriptions are detailed, the supplementary information contains the necessary information that does not fit into the main body of the article. The only concern is the reference list which is incomplete: the authors refer to 41 articles but only 38 are given under the reference list. Furthermore, the conclusion section and section 3.8 contain only qualitative information but the most important quantitative results could be mentioned . Once these are corrected, the manuscript can be published  (e.g. line 297: "trace levels" could be explicitly mentioned ).	{"700, 708, LOCATION","710, 724, LOCATION","661, 675, LOCATION","379, 384, TRIGGER","725, 730, MODAL","745, 754, ACTION","622, 632, ACTION","614, 619, MODAL","4, 14, LOCATION","623, 632, ACTION","578, 613, CONTENT","614, 619, MODAL","421, 432, CONTENT","570, 573, TRIGGER","541, 569, CONTENT","533, 540, ACTION","521, 532, LOCATION","498, 516, LOCATION","481, 492, TRIGGER","465, 479, LOCATION","449, 454, ACTION","437, 444, CONTENT","433, 436, TRIGGER","412, 417, ACTION","388, 398, ACTION","379, 384, TRIGGER","364, 378, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION"}
8850	The manuscript entitled“Vitamin D Supplementation Modestly Improves Serum Iron Levels of Arab Adolescent Boys, Not Girls” presents interesting issue and some corrections were made, but there are really major limitations of the study that reduce the possibility to conclude and reduce the scientific value of the presented data.	{"181, 184, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","23, 121, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","181, 184, TRIGGER"}
8851	2.      Authors assessed the influence of vitamin D in supplement/ fortified product, but with no assessment of the sunlight exposure and dietary vitamin D intake. In such situation, the scientific value of the presented data is low, as the major sources of vitamin D were not analysed. Authors should understand, that if they did not assess the vitamin D from the sunlight exposure (that may have differed between sub-groups), there is a huge bias. They should not only indicate it as a limitation, but also they should discuss the potential influence on the results (calculate what may be the general vitamin D synthesis and what may have been influence on the results).	{"646, 655, ACTION","514, 528, ACTION","569, 578, ACTION","533, 568, CONTENT","521, 528, ACTION","514, 520, MODAL","488, 498, CONTENT","579, 583, TRIGGER","584, 587, MODAL","471, 479, ACTION","627, 631, TRIGGER","455, 461, MODAL","632, 635, MODAL","346, 448, CONTENT","656, 670, CONTENT","591, 622, CONTENT","331, 341, ACTION","319, 321, TRIGGER","302, 312, ACTION","295, 301, MODAL","86, 89, TRIGGER","295, 301, MODAL","241, 267, CONTENT","86, 89, TRIGGER","500, 503, TRIGGER","273, 285, ACTION"}

8854	Authors should keep moderation while indicating  the observations – due to the major limitations, they can not conclude undoubtedly.

8859	The serious differences between intervention and control group seem to be a major problem. Such results must be explained . – Information, that“There was no significant difference in baseline mean 25(OH)D levels across groups” is not a proper explanation.

8866	The manuscript entitled“Citrus and winery wastes: promising dietary supplements for sustainable ruminant meat production and quality in low-income countries” presents very interesting issue and a novel approach that remains within the scope of the Sustainability journal. However, there are some major issues, that must be corrected , so it deserves to be published, but only after some major re-arrangement of the manuscript.	{"4, 14, LOCATION","272, 279, TRIGGER","322, 332, ACTION","315, 319, MODAL","272, 279, TRIGGER","315, 319, MODAL","415, 425, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","323, 332, ACTION","393, 407, ACTION","23, 157, LOCATION","296, 308, ACTION"}
8867	Two main problems in the manuscript are associated with:	{"0, 17, CONTENT","25, 35, LOCATION","25, 35, LOCATION"}
8868	(1)    A huge number of irrelevant information (or information that are just slightly relevant for the aim of the study) – e.g. detailed classification of countries as producers of specific citrus fruits (lines 94-99), that is to some extent reproduced in the table 1.	{"205, 216, LOCATION","205, 216, LOCATION","260, 267, LOCATION","128, 203, CONTENT","24, 46, ACTION"}
8869	Authors should not present all the information that they found in the literature, but they must select information with some criticism. Some information are not so relevant for the main aim of the study and must be either reduced or removed .	{"104, 134, CONTENT","8, 14, MODAL","15, 26, ACTION","27, 80, CONTENT","91, 95, MODAL","96, 102, ACTION","136, 152, CONTENT","157, 172, ACTION","197, 202, LOCATION","215, 221, TRIGGER","222, 229, ACTION","230, 232, TRIGGER","233, 240, ACTION","207, 211, MODAL","82, 85, TRIGGER","91, 102, ACTION","8, 14, MODAL"}
8870	Moreover, Authors must realize, that the main part of their study is presented in chapters 5, 7, 8 and 9 (by the way, what about chapter 6 – was there any chapter that was removed?) – this part requires very specific information, related directly to specific studies, while the previous chapters are just introductory ones and should be significantly reduced as not related  directly with the aim of the study.	{"118, 122, TRIGGER","336, 373, ACTION","18, 22, MODAL","94, 95, LOCATION","362, 373, ACTION","375, 409, CONTENT","0, 8, TRIGGER","18, 22, MODAL","23, 30, ACTION","32, 78, CONTENT","82, 92, LOCATION","97, 98, LOCATION","103, 104, LOCATION","106, 116, TRIGGER","118, 122, TRIGGER","129, 138, LOCATION","141, 144, TRIGGER","155, 162, LOCATION","163, 179, CONTENT","184, 193, LOCATION","194, 202, ACTION","203, 228, CONTENT","230, 266, CONTENT","268, 273, TRIGGER","278, 295, LOCATION","327, 333, MODAL","351, 358, ACTION"}
8871	(2)    An significant generalization, which results from the fact, that Authors want to present the general conclusions while it is not always possible. It is observed even for the title, as Authors are generalizing following aspects:	{"181, 186, LOCATION","38, 43, TRIGGER","181, 186, LOCATION"}
8872	(a)    Combining citrus and winery wastes together – the various bioactive compounds are observed in indicated by-products, while the indicated fruits are produced in various countries – Authors must reflect if they should be combined  in one study. If so, they should think about dividing  their manuscript into two independent parts – associated with citrus and winery wastes separately	{"225, 234, ACTION","195, 199, MODAL","297, 307, LOCATION","297, 307, LOCATION","281, 289, ACTION","195, 199, MODAL","200, 207, ACTION","262, 268, MODAL","226, 235, ACTION","216, 222, MODAL","307, 388, CONTENT"}
8873	(b)   Generalizing the observed results for the low income countries – it should be specified  for which countries the observations may be generalized  (if country does not produce citrus fruits or wine it is not the promising solution for such country). Moreover – why only for low income countries (does the high income one not profit from such approach?)?	{"270, 357, CONTENT","255, 263, TRIGGER","74, 80, MODAL","153, 155, TRIGGER","84, 93, ACTION","95, 150, CONTENT","266, 269, TRIGGER","99, 104, TRIGGER","74, 80, MODAL","83, 93, ACTION"}
8874	(c)    Generalizing the observed results for all the by-products (peels, seeds, pulp, etc.), while some of them may be more promising  than others and the bioactive components share differs between them, as well as the volume of production also differs.	{"115, 133, ACTION"}
8875	(3)    Combining data that should not be combined  together due to a high difference. It may be indicated in the context of presented  above generalizing, but it becomes especially alarming for the detailed data (as presented in tables). As Authors combined data from the number of various studies together (various fruits, various geographical location), they observed a great diversification of the results – e.g. Table 2: Ca – 4.9-17.0 g, Zn – 6.0-57.0 g (!). Results presented in such way have no scientific value, as readers do not know what is the level of nutrient (as e.g. for Zn – it may be 10 times higher or lower…), as well as they do not know which factors influence the level. It results from the fact, that Authors presented the results from all the studies for citrus peel and pulp combined (while not only the type of citrus fruit, but also cultivar and country may influence).	{"40, 49, ACTION","229, 235, LOCATION","155, 158, TRIGGER","27, 33, MODAL","493, 517, ACTION","416, 423, LOCATION","229, 235, LOCATION","27, 37, MODAL","7, 21, CONTENT","41, 49, ACTION","51, 84, CONTENT","89, 92, MODAL","96, 105, ACTION","106, 153, CONTENT","155, 158, TRIGGER","159, 211, CONTENT","425, 440, LOCATION","442, 458, LOCATION","463, 492, CONTENT"}
8876	The manuscript by Gomes et al. describes the synthesis, characterisation of imprinted polymers, and their use in a continuous extraction process. The topic fits well within the scope of Processes, and the work is of interest to a broad audience including chemical engineers, polymer chemists and materials scientists. However, the introduction has to be thoroughly revised, and some technical issues have to be clarified, prior to further consideration for publication in the journal.	{"4, 14, LOCATION","378, 399, CONTENT","411, 420, ACTION","318, 325, TRIGGER","331, 343, LOCATION","365, 372, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION","318, 325, TRIGGER"}

8882	6. The subject of the manuscript is quite similar to the recently published article under Green Chem., 2017, 19, 3116-3125, which also presents a continuous process using polyphenol-imprinted polymers. Consequently, the authors should mention and briefly compare their process with the one in the literature. Furthermore, literature on the use of imprinted polymers for continuous processes is scarce and should be summarised  in the introduction (Green Chem., 2015, 17, 5196-5205; J. Chromatogr. A, 2011, 1218, 5664-5674; React. Funct.

8885	9. In general the discussions are very lengthy for a research article with many textbook-like comments. For instance, lines 236-270 (full page) should be shortened  to a few lines only focusing on the results and their discussion, instead of a general discussion on imprinted polymers.

8891	15. The proposed application is a continuous extraction process with imprinted polymers, and consequently, the authors should mention the potential of imprinted polymers’ excessive reusability at the end of Section 3.8: Polym.

8895	The manuscript entitled“Antioxidative efficacy of Mastiha supplement and effect on plasma amino acid profile in inflammatory bowel disease; a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial” presents interesting issue but some major corrections are needed.	{"4, 14, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","221, 224, TRIGGER","221, 224, TRIGGER","225, 247, CONTENT","248, 258, ACTION","23, 193, LOCATION"}
8896	In spite of the fact that Authors compared treatments (in supplementary table 3), on the basis of indicated results, it seems that in a studied group there were some patients (one of them?) who received a combined treatment (the total number of treatments is higher than the total number of patients). Taking it into account, it must be considered  if there were also any patients who did not receive any treatment (and others received a combined treatments with some medications)? Authors should change their statistical analysis and present combined treatment with 2 or more groups of medications as a separate category, as well as a lack of treatment.	{"58, 79, LOCATION","543, 653, CONTENT","349, 480, CONTENT","504, 530, CONTENT","58, 71, LOCATION","336, 347, ACTION","329, 333, MODAL","337, 347, ACTION","329, 333, MODAL","490, 496, MODAL","496, 503, ACTION","535, 542, ACTION"}
8897	Authors compared also some variables (but other than indicated above) – in supplementary table 3, but they compared UC and CD patients from experimental and control group separately, so it is not known if the combined experimental and control groups differ. In the main body of the study, Authors analysed combined groups, so such presentation in the supplementary material does not correspond the studied data. With such detailed comparison, it is not known if the presented data are reliable.	{"75, 88, LOCATION","89, 96, LOCATION","75, 88, LOCATION","265, 274, LOCATION","351, 373, LOCATION","38, 41, TRIGGER","98, 101, TRIGGER"}
8898	2.       The other important problem is associated with the fact that Authors assessed the AA plasma composition but with no information about the diet. Authors did not present any information about the diet before assessment (was the assessment done in the fasting state or not? was the previous meal/ previous day meal analysed? etc).	{"161, 176, ACTION","284, 329, CONTENT","231, 278, CONTENT","177, 225, CONTENT","113, 116, TRIGGER","113, 116, TRIGGER","227, 230, TRIGGER","280, 284, TRIGGER"}
8899	Moreover, Authors did not analyse any general diet of patients (were they recommended to follow ay diet? what was the AA profile of the diet?) Authors should have at least their 3d-DR or 24h-DR and on the basis of it assess the influence of applied diet on the AA profile, as it is the main factor influencing AA profile.	{"178, 183, CONTENT","105, 110, TRIGGER","151, 157, MODAL","157, 162, ACTION","187, 193, CONTENT","151, 157, MODAL","105, 109, TRIGGER","184, 186, TRIGGER","198, 320, CONTENT","110, 140, CONTENT","64, 103, CONTENT","34, 62, CONTENT","0, 8, TRIGGER","18, 33, ACTION"}
8900	The procedure of using the Mastiha name is controversial, as it is not only the traditional name, but also a trade name of specific supplement, so Authors should avoid using  such term and instead, they should rather use the name indicating  the content or origin (e.g. Pistacia lentiscus).	{"98, 101, TRIGGER","221, 263, CONTENT","168, 184, CONTENT","39, 56, ACTION","0, 39, CONTENT","270, 288, CONTENT","217, 220, ACTION","203, 209, MODAL","155, 162, MODAL","162, 168, ACTION","98, 101, TRIGGER","161, 173, ACTION"}
8901	The manuscript is shabbily prepared: e.g. the bold typing should be removed  (e.g. line 17), the punctuations marks should be corrected  (e.g. line 72), the abbreviations should be presented  with dots (e.g. line 41), etc.	{"181, 190, ACTION","208, 215, LOCATION","126, 135, ACTION","58, 64, MODAL","68, 75, ACTION","83, 90, LOCATION","116, 122, MODAL","143, 150, LOCATION","171, 177, MODAL","4, 14, LOCATION","67, 75, ACTION","58, 64, MODAL","15, 35, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION","192, 201, CONTENT","153, 170, CONTENT","93, 115, CONTENT","42, 57, CONTENT"}

8906	The section is improperly prepared taking into account the title of the study – this section should justify the need to conduct the study, while in the present form, there is lack of such justification.	{"108, 201, CONTENT","12, 34, ACTION","80, 92, LOCATION","93, 107, ACTION","59, 64, LOCATION","4, 11, LOCATION","93, 99, MODAL","100, 107, ACTION"}
8907	Lines 41-47 – Authors indicated the aspects associated with arterial events in IBD ones, but it is not explained why they did it. The title indicated antioxidative effect and AA profile, but nothing associated with arterial events, so such extensive paragraph is not associated with the study.	{"187, 190, TRIGGER","0, 11, LOCATION","89, 92, TRIGGER","134, 139, LOCATION","89, 92, TRIGGER","0, 11, LOCATION","96, 112, ACTION","32, 87, CONTENT"}

8909	Lines 48-61 – Authors extensively presented the applied supplement – with only lines 54-58 are directly associated with the study.

8910	Lines 62-64 – the own unpublished data should not be presented .

8912	In general, the applied methodology is associated with a serious limitation of the study. Authors combined CD and UC patients, while it is well known, that symptoms and disease course differ, so it may have influenced the observed results. Moreover, as treated active disease individuals were studied (after at least 2 weeks of treatment), it is hard to guess if the observed effect is the real effect of applied supplement or rather the effect of a serious treatment applied for at least 2 weeks (e.g. steroids). In order to explain it, Authors should precisely present the characteristics of sub-groups and compare variables between sub-groups (applied therapy, therapy duration, symptoms, etc.).	{"240, 248, TRIGGER","198, 201, MODAL","575, 697, CONTENT","563, 570, ACTION","546, 552, MODAL"}
8913	The inclusion/ exclusion criteria should be more specific (e.g. “vegan of macrobiotic diet before […] the trial” – was the vegan diet following in any moment in the past the exclusion criterion?,“any malignancy” – were any cancer survivors excluded or excluded were only those with cancer diagnosed/ treated during the previous year?).	{"214, 218, TRIGGER","115, 118, TRIGGER","195, 211, LOCATION","34, 41, MODAL","34, 40, MODAL","49, 57, ACTION","0, 33, CONTENT","64, 112, LOCATION","119, 193, CONTENT","195, 211, LOCATION","219, 332, CONTENT"}
8914	It should be justified why only active but moderate disease ones were included . It may be a serious limitation of the study, as only individuals with active but moderate IBD cured for at least 2 weeks were studied.

8938	8. The authors claim“almost pure lignin” from the bio-refinery process.

8947	The content of the manuscript is of interest to both professionals and academics from the various disciplines including analytical chemistry, HPLC, pharmaceuticals, and polymer science. The arguments are well-built and the data is represented in a clear way. Nonetheless, setting the background must be improved and some important technical questions need to be clarified and addressed  prior to publication.	{"19, 29, LOCATION","316, 350, CONTENT","272, 294, CONTENT","295, 299, MODAL","351, 355, MODAL","362, 371, ACTION","376, 385, ACTION","295, 299, MODAL","302, 385, ACTION","19, 29, LOCATION","259, 270, TRIGGER","303, 311, ACTION"}
8948	2) Page 1, line 25:“similar abilities” -> Rephrase the sentence with a quantitative statement. In general the abstract is somewhat vague, and needs improvement by adding quantitative discussions.	{"10, 18, LOCATION","3, 9, LOCATION","3, 9, LOCATION","42, 50, ACTION","19, 38, LOCATION","160, 194, CONTENT","148, 159, ACTION","142, 147, MODAL","119, 136, ACTION","109, 118, LOCATION","51, 93, CONTENT"}
8949	3) Bulk referencing for line 32 in page 1 should be avoided , one single reference to a book/review is sufficient.	{"3, 19, CONTENT","62, 99, CONTENT","51, 59, ACTION","24, 31, LOCATION","35, 41, LOCATION","42, 48, MODAL","52, 59, ACTION","24, 31, LOCATION","42, 48, MODAL"}
8950	4) Although well-constructed, the introduction to the topic is narrowly focused on cellulose based CSPs. For setting the background for the manuscript, the introduction needs to contain some general information about the importance and need for enantioseparation, and briefly describe some other state-of-the-art adsorbent materials that can be used  for enantioseparation such as helical polymers (Nature Chem. 2014, 6, 429–434), imprinted polymers (ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2015, 7 9516–9525), metal-organic frameworks (Anal. Chem. 2014, 86, 1277–1281), and graphene oxide (J. Chromatogr.

8953	8) The description of the preparation of Cel-1…7 is about half a page long but the text is exactly the same.

8954	9) The characterisation of the final products is limited. Have the authors carried out any elemental analysis, FTIR etc to characterise the prepared oligomers? How was the attachment of the isocyanate to the cellulose quantified? Was it the same for all oligomers? It attachment (i.e. surface coverage) will have an effect on the enantioseparation ability of the final stationary phase.	{"160, 163, TRIGGER","303, 307, MODAL","230, 233, TRIGGER","160, 163, TRIGGER","58, 62, TRIGGER","75, 158, CONTENT","164, 228, CONTENT","234, 263, CONTENT"}

8978	The manuscript by Yang et al. is of interest to the readers of Water. A good amount of data is presented by the authors and the methodology is new.

8979	1. Revise the grammar, and correct typos, which can be found even in the title. Space is numerous sentences throughout the manuscript. Space should be added  between values and units throughout the manuscript.	{"35, 40, CONTENT","10, 21, CONTENT","198, 208, LOCATION","135, 140, CONTENT","123, 133, LOCATION","80, 107, CONTENT","54, 60, ACTION","48, 51, MODAL","158, 182, CONTENT","42, 47, TRIGGER","151, 157, ACTION","141, 147, MODAL","73, 78, LOCATION","27, 34, ACTION","3, 9, ACTION","73, 78, LOCATION","150, 156, ACTION","48, 51, MODAL"}

8981	3. Line 56-69: This paragraph is a long description of the experimental work, and consequently should not be part of the introduction.

8989	The manuscript describes a new experimental methodology for graphene derivatives with arc discharge, and complements it with theoretical modelling. A good amount of new data is presented in the manuscript. The topic is of interest to the readers of Coatings. However, there are several issues that need addition, clarification and correction, therefore major revision is recommended before a final decision is made.	{"4, 15, LOCATION","278, 292, CONTENT","298, 302, MODAL","303, 311, ACTION","194, 204, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","258, 266, TRIGGER","259, 266, TRIGGER","313, 326, ACTION","331, 341, ACTION"}
8990	1, The general applicability and transfer of the proposed methodology to other types of materials fabrication, such as different 2D materials, should be discussed .

8993	4, Grouping references should be avoided  as a research article should not read as a chemical abstract. For instance line 122 has large number of references grouped: [54-66] and [67-83]. Either delete them or mention the most important ones individually.	{"3, 22, CONTENT","64, 74, MODAL","75, 79, ACTION","126, 164, CONTENT","217, 253, CONTENT","80, 102, CONTENT","32, 40, ACTION","23, 29, MODAL","94, 102, LOCATION","178, 185, LOCATION","23, 29, MODAL","166, 173, LOCATION","117, 125, LOCATION","33, 40, ACTION","209, 216, ACTION","194, 200, ACTION"}
8994	5, Standard deviations and errors are not given throughout the manuscript. The authors need to demonstrate reproducibility and add some discussions about the possible errors with regards to the measurements and characterizations. The reproducibility of the materials should be discussed .

8999	The major limitation of the study is associated with a number of samples. In spite of the fact that Authors analysed 8 cuts, it seems that for each of them they assessed only 3 samples. As a result, the number of samples is insufficient to conclude, as based on such number of samples, they can not have reliable observations, due to a natural variability of meat.	{"291, 294, MODAL"}
9000	In order to have the reliable observations, it would be necessary to have some batches (animals), for each of them some samples and for each sample – some repetitions.	{"69, 73, ACTION","47, 52, MODAL","47, 52, MODAL","74, 166, CONTENT"}

9036	2, It is necessary to disclose the amount of permeate collected during the filtration to obtain the water flux (line 139). How did the authors ensure constant flux and steady state operation? Flux and permeance need to be reported at steady state. Same comments are valid for oil-water separation tests.	{"231, 246, CONTENT","22, 30, ACTION","31, 110, CONTENT","127, 190, CONTENT","192, 211, CONTENT","248, 302, CONTENT","123, 126, TRIGGER","123, 126, TRIGGER","112, 120, LOCATION","112, 120, LOCATION","211, 215, MODAL","222, 230, ACTION"}

In particular, it may accelerate dangerous localized corrosion that can seriously weaken the coated metals (10.1038/nnano.2017.187).	{"28, 43, CONTENT","46, 119, CONTENT","157, 273, CONTENT","14, 19, MODAL","130, 139, ACTION","129, 139, ACTION","120, 126, MODAL","120, 126, MODAL","23, 27, ACTION"}
9071	2, The authors should discuss the long-term performance of these coatings, and gather all studies in a single table to compare the results include also 10.1016/j.flatc.2016.08.003.	{"15, 29, ACTION","79, 85, ACTION","22, 29, ACTION","15, 21, MODAL","86, 179, CONTENT","30, 73, CONTENT"}
9072	3, Examples to make graphene coatings more robust should be also mentioned  (10.1016/j.matt.2019.04.005; 10.1021/acsnano.8b02373).	{"3, 49, CONTENT","59, 74, ACTION","65, 74, ACTION","50, 56, MODAL","77, 128, CONTENT","50, 56, MODAL"}

9074	5, A comprehensive review on graphene-based anti-corrosive coatings was recently published (10.1016/j.cej.2019.05.034). The authors need to mention this and highlight what the current review adds to the discussion, and in what way it is different and more than what was published before.	{"167, 286, CONTENT","3, 118, CONTENT","140, 147, ACTION","203, 213, LOCATION","157, 166, ACTION","167, 171, TRIGGER","132, 136, MODAL"}
9075	6, Table 1 should include in separate columns both the advantages and disadvantages of each method presented in the table itself. This will assist the readers to quickly grasp the pros and cons of the different methodologies and ultimately assist in decision making .	{"3, 10, LOCATION","10, 17, MODAL","18, 25, ACTION","11, 25, ACTION","3, 10, LOCATION","26, 128, CONTENT"}
9077	8, The manuscript starts in medias res. A general but brief introduction to graphene should be given, and its widespread applications should be exemplified : electronics 10.1021/acsapm.0c00539; breaking emulsions 10.1016/j.memsci.2020.118007; gas separation 10.1021/acsapm.9b00426; catalysis 10.1039/D0GC01274B; electrodialysis 10.1039/C8TA09160A; biomimetics 10.1039/C9GC02266J; nanofiltration 10.1021/acsami.8b03591.	{"380, 417, CONTENT","143, 155, ACTION","144, 155, ACTION","158, 192, CONTENT","85, 91, MODAL","95, 100, ACTION","194, 241, CONTENT","243, 280, CONTENT","50, 53, TRIGGER","282, 310, CONTENT","312, 346, CONTENT","85, 91, MODAL","348, 378, CONTENT","134, 140, MODAL","7, 17, LOCATION","40, 84, CONTENT","7, 17, LOCATION","106, 133, CONTENT"}

9080	11, The adhesion strength of the graphene coatings should be discussed  in more depth, and the parameters affecting it should be analysed  and suggestions made for improvements. In general, future directions are expected in a review, and the authors failed to show the weaknesses of the coatings and where the field should be heading .	{"90, 118, CONTENT","4, 50, CONTENT","71, 85, CONTENT","143, 176, CONTENT","119, 125, MODAL","129, 137, ACTION","61, 70, ACTION","51, 57, MODAL","300, 305, TRIGGER","51, 57, MODAL","60, 70, ACTION"}

9101	20) The conclusions section should summarize the main research findings, and preferably it should include some quantitative statements. The drawbacks and limitations of the computational methods should be also mentioned  to add a critical edge. Furthermore, the potential impact of the research should be mentioned .	{"305, 314, ACTION","8, 27, LOCATION","28, 34, MODAL","35, 44, ACTION","210, 219, ACTION","98, 105, ACTION","91, 105, ACTION","245, 256, TRIGGER","195, 201, MODAL","28, 34, MODAL","295, 301, MODAL","91, 97, MODAL","257, 294, CONTENT","220, 243, CONTENT","136, 194, CONTENT","106, 134, CONTENT","45, 71, CONTENT"}

9110	For proper justification of the conducted study, Authors should refer the recent studies of other authors, as well as the other most important studies, to present the current stage of knowledge (e.g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4836385/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3681827/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4107158/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25522/).	{"167, 193, CONTENT","194, 410, CONTENT","155, 162, ACTION","57, 69, ACTION","63, 69, ACTION","57, 63, MODAL","107, 117, TRIGGER","70, 105, CONTENT","4, 47, CONTENT","0, 3, TRIGGER","118, 150, CONTENT"}

9112	The provided Introduction section is excessive (lines 25-168, while a number of information is not associated with the aim of the study), with excessive number of references (57 references, while a number of them is not relevant for the conducted study).	{"13, 25, LOCATION","48, 60, LOCATION","13, 33, LOCATION","69, 91, CONTENT","229, 252, CONTENT","34, 46, ACTION","95, 109, ACTION","110, 135, CONTENT","143, 159, ACTION","163, 173, LOCATION","175, 188, LOCATION","216, 228, ACTION"}

9117	Results and Discussion:	{"12, 22, LOCATION","0, 22, LOCATION"}
9118	The most important problem is associated with the fact that in a scientific paper Authors should not present their own impressions (“By not knowing, I was reminded of my prejudices and color-blindness regarding race and ethnicity, for instance I found myself making assumptions based upon the students' appearances.”, or “For example, in my eagerness to look for stories that could break with stereotypic images regarding  PE and ethnicity, I became too focused on looking for specific situations of engagement among some of the girls in the two classes. In this way, I missed important observations on what might have influenced processes of exclusion in the lessons.”), but only the data that they obtained from the conducted interviews.	{"676, 680, TRIGGER","132, 316, LOCATION","681, 738, CONTENT","321, 669, LOCATION","90, 96, MODAL","603, 607, TRIGGER","672, 675, TRIGGER","109, 131, CONTENT","381, 421, ACTION","96, 108, ACTION","90, 96, MODAL"}
9119	There is not enough information obtained from the interviews presented. Authors should present the specific opinions of respondents, grouped by the subject and then conclude based on the obtained data. For the time being, there are mainly private (subjective) opinions of Authors, that are not supported by any data (information from interviews).	{"80, 94, ACTION","86, 94, ACTION","99, 131, CONTENT","165, 173, ACTION","80, 86, MODAL","141, 155, CONTENT","20, 70, CONTENT","9, 19, ACTION","304, 345, CONTENT","290, 303, ACTION","239, 268, ACTION","174, 200, CONTENT","133, 140, ACTION"}
9120	The methodological information should be presented  in Materials and Methods Section (e.g. “In order to identify classes where students had diverse ethnic and cultural background, the school chose classes for the fieldwork based on numbers of bilingual students in a class (approximately 40%). However, I was not familiar with whom where bilingual or not. Viewing identities as multiple, fluid and shifting, this approach allowed me to explore how and when ethnicity mattered, as well as the inter/intra-ethnic relation among students.”).	{"91, 536, LOCATION","121, 126, TRIGGER","31, 37, MODAL","40, 50, ACTION","4, 30, CONTENT","41, 50, ACTION","31, 37, MODAL","55, 84, LOCATION"}
9121	Authors should present and discuss the limitations of their study.	{"15, 22, ACTION","8, 22, ACTION","8, 14, MODAL","39, 65, CONTENT","27, 34, ACTION"}
9352	Authors must correct the included references, while removing excessive self-referring is necessary. Authors referred at least 10 own studies (indicating the number of them precisely is impossible as Authors improperly referred studies indicating only the first author) – a number of referred own studies are in Chinese, so can not be read by international readers (no. 7, 8, 20, 24, 25, 40) and moreover, a number of them is irrelevant for the aim of the study (no. 7, 19, 24, 25).	{"46, 51, TRIGGER","425, 435, ACTION","455, 460, LOCATION","395, 403, TRIGGER","395, 403, TRIGGER","100, 363, CONTENT","323, 326, MODAL","8, 20, ACTION","13, 21, ACTION","34, 44, LOCATION","52, 61, ACTION","61, 86, CONTENT","365, 389, LOCATION","462, 479, LOCATION","8, 13, MODAL"}
9354	In general, in the case of studies involving human subjects (also for the retrospective analysis), the agreement of the ethics committee is compulsory – as it is defined:‘No one should participate in research unless independent review concludes that the risks are reasonable in relation to the potential benefits.’ (National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) - https://bioethicsarchive.georgetown.edu/nbac/human/oversumm.html).	{"178, 184, MODAL","170, 314, LOCATION"}

Therefore „the lowest” or „the highest” phrases should not be stated  in lines 216 and 284.

9390	The manuscript entitled „Validation of a revised food frequency questionnaire for assessment of calcium, vitamin D and protein intake in a population of elderly men and women with fragility fracture” presents an important issue of validating a new practical tool to assess the intake, but the study requires the major revisions and in the presented form.

9391	The applied method of validation and concluding is improper.

9393	According to the recommendations of Cade, the specific methods should be applied  in the validation studies. The analysis of correlation is not the recommended method (so Authors should not conclude on the basis of it). At the same time, the kappa statistic and Bland-Altman method are the recommended methods. Authors should rather include the kappa statistics instead of analysis of correlations. While Authors used the Bland-Altman method, they applied it improperly. They should calculate the Bland-Altman index (in %) and conclude on the basis of the commonly indicated criteria (e.g. presented by Myles & Cui, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17702826).	{"113, 136, CONTENT","89, 107, LOCATION","73, 82, ACTION","63, 70, MODAL","55, 61, LOCATION","72, 80, ACTION","63, 69, MODAL","603, 660, CONTENT","326, 333, TRIGGER","242, 281, CONTENT","422, 441, CONTENT","527, 536, ACTION","483, 523, CONTENT","476, 483, ACTION","448, 469, ACTION","373, 397, CONTENT","345, 362, CONTENT","333, 341, ACTION","319, 325, MODAL","186, 198, ACTION","179, 186, MODAL"}

Bland-Altman index of maximum 5% (95% of individuals within the limit of agreement) is interpreted as a positive validation. For total protein and calcium 28 individuals of 30 are within the LOA – 6.7%, while for vitamin D – 27 of 30 (10%). As a result, it may not be concluded , that for vitamin D the questionnaire is positively validated. At the same time, the values of 6.7% may be interpreted  as a borderline significant, as it is commonly being done. Currently the figures and conclusions are inconsistent.	{"20, 23, TRIGGER","157, 161, MODAL","6, 19, ACTION","20, 23, TRIGGER","24, 63, CONTENT","104, 155, CONTENT","433, 436, MODAL","95, 102, LOCATION","660, 671, LOCATION","676, 688, CONTENT","648, 656, LOCATION","57, 63, LOCATION","163, 173, ACTION","157, 160, MODAL"}

9434	In the Discussion section, Authors should discuss the validity in the context of other validations published by other authors. Currently, they did not discuss the main issue analyzed in their study. There are a lot of published validations of FFQs with the presented Bland-Altman results, that should be presented and compared  with own results. Moreover, a lot of authors indicate the borderline significant LOA as still valid, so it may be for Authors a good point in their discussion. E.g. for vitamin D it is in the studies such as https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24524060, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26742070, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257701/, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19248866.

9437	In this manuscript, Hussein and co-workers describe the preparation and characterisation of palm kernel shell activated carbon. An excessive amount of experimental data were collected and presented in the manuscript. The research topic is timely and globally important. The work is novel and of interest to the broad readership of Nanomaterials. However, the article has several issues regarding the presentation of data, and setting the context and background for the research. The latter is currently limited and must be broadened  as per the commetns below. Consequently, major revision is recommended to address the points below prior to further consideration for publishing in Nanomaterials.	{"581, 590, ACTION","503, 510, ACTION","523, 534, ACTION","438, 477, CONTENT","479, 489, CONTENT","379, 385, ACTION","346, 353, TRIGGER","359, 366, LOCATION","400, 420, CONTENT","8, 18, LOCATION","346, 353, TRIGGER","522, 532, ACTION","515, 519, MODAL","8, 18, LOCATION","515, 519, MODAL"}
9438	1) The intended application area of the materials should be mentioned  at the end of the abstract.	{"89, 97, LOCATION","50, 56, MODAL","50, 57, MODAL","60, 71, ACTION","78, 97, LOCATION","7, 49, CONTENT","59, 69, ACTION"}
9439	2) Figure 1 as raw data should be moved  to a supporting information document. Figure 2 is sufficient to be included in the main manuscript. The sample principle applies to Figure 3 and 4, i.e. move Figure 3 to the supporting information and only keep Figure 4 in the main manuscript. Figure 6 is unnecessary to understand the manuscript, delete it, and only mention the necessary size in the text.	{"247, 252, ACTION","33, 39, ACTION","3, 11, LOCATION","3, 11, LOCATION","24, 31, MODAL","252, 260, LOCATION","285, 293, LOCATION","393, 397, LOCATION","268, 283, LOCATION","346, 348, CONTENT","339, 345, ACTION","327, 337, LOCATION","297, 308, ACTION","124, 139, LOCATION","215, 237, LOCATION","108, 116, ACTION","46, 77, LOCATION","173, 187, LOCATION","199, 207, LOCATION","79, 87, LOCATION","34, 41, ACTION","194, 199, ACTION","359, 367, ACTION","367, 385, CONTENT","24, 30, MODAL"}
9440	3) The accuracy of the methods applied should be discussed  in the experimental section, and the significant digits should be considered when presenting the data, e.g. see Table 3.	{"49, 58, ACTION","7, 30, CONTENT","96, 115, CONTENT","172, 179, LOCATION","126, 137, ACTION","116, 123, MODAL","67, 87, LOCATION","39, 46, MODAL","172, 179, LOCATION","48, 58, ACTION","39, 45, MODAL","137, 141, TRIGGER"}
9441	4) The authors need to discuss the reproducibility of the materials synthesis as well as the reproducibility of the adsorption process. Were independently prepared adsorbents tested? What are the standard deviations? There is very limited discussion on these issues in the manuscript and it is scattered and somewhat unclear. These should be more comprehensively summarized .	{"239, 249, LOCATION","253, 265, CONTENT","183, 188, TRIGGER","141, 181, CONTENT","317, 324, ACTION","15, 20, MODAL","23, 31, ACTION","363, 374, ACTION","273, 283, LOCATION","136, 141, TRIGGER","35, 134, CONTENT","332, 339, MODAL","226, 249, ACTION","196, 215, CONTENT","294, 303, ACTION","332, 338, MODAL","183, 187, TRIGGER","341, 373, ACTION"}

9443	6) Palm kernel shell is a sustainable source for materials. Given the global trend toward sustainable solutions, the fact that palm kernel shell is a sustainable/green resource, the authors should explicitly mention this. Examples for sustainable adsorption including materials and processes perspectives should be given in the introduction: Green Chem., 2017, 19, 3116-3125; Waste Management, 2011, 31, 1350-1356; Green Chem., 2015, 17, 5196-5205.	{"415, 447, CONTENT","222, 304, CONTENT","342, 374, CONTENT","3, 58, CONTENT","376, 413, CONTENT","328, 340, LOCATION","328, 340, LOCATION","315, 320, ACTION","305, 312, MODAL","208, 216, ACTION","190, 197, MODAL","190, 196, MODAL"}

9445	8) At the end of the paragraph on activating agents (line 60), the authors should mention that there is a need for recycling /recovering these agents and the water/solvents used for the treatment process, and give broad examples for sustainable recovery processes from the literature: Desalination, 2003, 157, 87-95; ChemSusChem, 2017, 10, 3435-3444; J.

9446	9) Line 74: Specify if the percentage is weight or volume percentage. Moreover, was agitation applied during the pre-treatment? The actual treatment process should be explicitly mentioned .	{"70, 78, TRIGGER","70, 78, TRIGGER","3, 10, LOCATION","166, 187, ACTION","157, 163, MODAL","128, 156, CONTENT","51, 68, CONTENT","48, 50, TRIGGER","23, 47, CONTENT","20, 22, TRIGGER","80, 126, CONTENT","178, 188, ACTION","157, 164, MODAL","12, 20, ACTION","3, 10, LOCATION"}
9447	10) Avoid using x/y format for the references and use the recommended x y^-1 throughout the manuscript. Currently both formats are used in a random fashion.	{"35, 46, LOCATION","92, 102, LOCATION","15, 26, LOCATION","50, 54, ACTION","4, 10, ACTION","70, 76, CONTENT","92, 102, LOCATION"}
9448	11)“for 2 h holding time at 10 oC/min heating rate.” -> This description is confusing. At which temperature the 2 h holding time was applied? Give more detail on the heating process.	{"96, 140, CONTENT","90, 96, TRIGGER","56, 72, CONTENT","90, 95, TRIGGER","3, 52, LOCATION","147, 181, CONTENT","142, 147, ACTION","73, 85, ACTION","3, 52, LOCATION"}

9451	In the presented work the authors prepared nanocomposite materials for capacitive deionization and investigated their performance. The prepared nanomaterials were characterized and their desalination performance was assessed. The presented approach is interesting but the potential impact on the field needs to be clarified. The following minor and major issues need to be addressed prior to further consideration by the journal.	{"314, 323, ACTION","362, 366, MODAL","264, 267, TRIGGER","373, 382, ACTION","325, 361, CONTENT","282, 301, CONTENT","264, 268, TRIGGER","302, 307, MODAL"}
9452	2. The rationale for and the practicality of the selected concentrations for desalination should be discussed  in the manuscript; justification is needed.	{"99, 109, ACTION","118, 128, LOCATION","147, 153, ACTION","130, 144, CONTENT","118, 128, LOCATION","90, 97, MODAL","100, 111, ACTION","90, 96, MODAL","3, 89, CONTENT"}
9453	3. Why did the authors select the 3:1 reduced graphene oxide:titanium dioxide nanotube ratio? Was this ratio somehow optimized? What is the individual contribution of rGO and TiO2 components to the overall desalination performance? Deeper fundamental understanding of the system needs to be demonstrated in the paper, and the experimental design needs to be better explained.	{"365, 374, ACTION","279, 284, MODAL","232, 278, CONTENT","136, 230, CONTENT","98, 126, CONTENT","30, 92, CONTENT","346, 351, MODAL","3, 7, TRIGGER","307, 316, LOCATION","291, 304, ACTION","128, 132, TRIGGER","128, 133, TRIGGER","151, 163, LOCATION","94, 98, TRIGGER","326, 345, CONTENT"}
9455	5. Prior literature on graphene-based nanomaterials for desalination should be briefly mentioned  in the introduction, which is too short (DOIs: metal/GO complex: 10.1021/acsanm.8b01540; electrodialysis nanocomposite: 10.1039/C8TA09160A; pyrene/GO complexation: 10.1039/C8TA00623G; crosslinked polymer/GO membrane: 10.1021/acsami.8b03591; fullerene/GO: 10.1021/acsanm.8b01375).	{"125, 137, ACTION","139, 375, CONTENT","3, 68, CONTENT","69, 76, MODAL","87, 98, ACTION","105, 117, LOCATION","105, 117, LOCATION","78, 96, ACTION","69, 75, MODAL","119, 124, TRIGGER"}
9456	6. The feasibility of capacitive deionization with the proposed nanomaterials on large scale should be mentioned  in the manuscript. What are the pros and cons of the method? What are the limitations? Some critical comments should be added . Could the presented methodology be employed in other, related fields? The potential impact and general use of the methodology should be discussed  in the manuscript, either at the end of the results section or the conclusion section.	{"121, 131, LOCATION","121, 131, LOCATION","103, 114, ACTION","93, 100, MODAL","408, 415, TRIGGER","224, 231, MODAL","206, 223, CONTENT","133, 138, TRIGGER","368, 375, MODAL","175, 180, TRIGGER","102, 112, ACTION","422, 448, LOCATION","396, 406, LOCATION","378, 389, ACTION","456, 474, LOCATION","93, 99, MODAL","133, 137, TRIGGER","234, 240, ACTION","143, 173, CONTENT","248, 310, CONTENT","312, 367, CONTENT","3, 92, CONTENT","184, 199, CONTENT","242, 247, TRIGGER"}

9458	The manuscript entitled „Ecological Structure of Temperate Bacteriophages in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Affected Gut” presents interesting issue, but some areas must be corrected .	{"24, 121, LOCATION","150, 153, TRIGGER","165, 169, MODAL","150, 154, TRIGGER","0, 14, LOCATION","172, 182, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION","165, 170, MODAL","173, 183, ACTION"}
9459	It seems that none of Authors in a fluent English speaker, as some sentences are extremelly hard to follow or even to understand. Some sentences, such  as “Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex of intestinal disorders composed of Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).” are misleading and must be reformulated  e.g. into “Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) (it must be plural) is a group of intestinal diseases, including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)”.	{"340, 490, CONTENT","308, 312, MODAL","315, 328, ACTION","155, 288, LOCATION","130, 144, CONTENT","316, 328, ACTION","308, 312, MODAL"}

9474	The content of the manuscript is of interest to both professionals and academics from the various disciplines including chromatography, HPLC, and pharmaceuticals. The contribution is exceptionally important as it reveals some industrial insights to chiral separation from AstraZeneca. The arguments are well-built and the data is represented in a clear way. Nonetheless, setting the background needs to be improved and some technical questions need to be clarified and addressed prior to publication.	{"419, 443, CONTENT","394, 399, MODAL","444, 449, MODAL","455, 465, ACTION","370, 393, CONTENT","19, 30, LOCATION","406, 415, ACTION","19, 29, LOCATION","469, 479, ACTION","358, 369, TRIGGER"}
9475	1) Bulk referencing should be avoided  in the manuscript, see line 33, 55, 57, 59, 61, 75, 103. For instance references [1-3] are for a general statement which could be replaced  with one single reference to a recent book or review.	{"154, 159, TRIGGER","20, 26, MODAL","169, 179, ACTION","184, 231, CONTENT","29, 37, ACTION","46, 56, LOCATION","20, 27, MODAL","30, 39, ACTION","42, 56, LOCATION","160, 166, MODAL","3, 19, CONTENT","62, 94, LOCATION"}
9476	2) Some text appear with different font size and font style, see lines 37-38, 57-61, and they seem to be lifted from some other source. A quick search revealed that some part of the introduction was taken from (J. Chromatogr. B, 875 (2008) 230–236) with minor or no rephrasing. These sentences should be rewritten and the original source should be referenced  in the manuscript.	{"65, 83, LOCATION","195, 204, ACTION","210, 276, CONTENT","318, 337, CONTENT","8, 12, LOCATION","182, 195, LOCATION","294, 300, MODAL","303, 358, ACTION","278, 293, CONTENT","294, 301, MODAL","304, 314, ACTION","338, 345, MODAL","348, 360, ACTION","367, 377, LOCATION"}
9477	3) The introduction needs an additional short paragraph on CSPs to mention what are the conventional/commercial (e.g. cellulose, Polymer Journal, 2016, 38, 91–108) and state-of-the-art materials developed for the separation of enantiomers such as helical polymers (Nature Chem. 2014, 6, 429–434), imprinted polymers (ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2015, 7 9516–9525), metal-organic frameworks (Anal. Chem. 2014, 86, 1277–1281), and graphene oxide (J. Chromatogr.

9479	5) Lines 71-75 repeating the information already mentioned earlier in the introduction. These lines can be deleted  to avoid redundant information.	{"100, 103, MODAL","74, 86, LOCATION","3, 14, LOCATION","106, 114, ACTION","107, 116, ACTION","100, 104, MODAL","3, 14, LOCATION","88, 99, CONTENT"}
9480	6) The authors mention that in addition to solubility and stability of the compound in the mobile phase is also addressed but do not elaborate further. Explain in a follow-up sentence how and why solubility and stability were addressed in order to guide the readers.	{"196, 265, CONTENT","184, 188, TRIGGER","122, 126, TRIGGER","192, 196, TRIGGER","122, 125, TRIGGER","152, 160, ACTION","175, 183, LOCATION"}
9481	7) Line 90-91 should be shortened and combined  with line 89 which is the subtitle for this section, e.g.“2.2. Case study I: Application of SFC or NPLC in enantioseparation and impact of compound solubility”, follow similarly in the other case studies, again with the aim to guide the readers.	{"61, 66, TRIGGER","14, 20, MODAL","61, 67, TRIGGER","3, 13, LOCATION","23, 46, ACTION","105, 207, LOCATION","3, 13, LOCATION","14, 21, MODAL","24, 34, ACTION","87, 99, LOCATION","73, 82, LOCATION","38, 46, ACTION","53, 60, LOCATION"}
9482	8) Throughout the manuscript API names are not revealed which is probably due to confidentiality reasons. However, at least the API class of the compounds should be revealed  for each cases (e.g. steroid, tetracycline, benzodiazepines, fibrates etc. This general information would immensely help the readers to understand the case studies and put them in context.	{"124, 154, CONTENT","155, 162, MODAL","18, 28, LOCATION","46, 55, ACTION","155, 161, MODAL","56, 61, TRIGGER","165, 175, ACTION","196, 245, CONTENT","18, 29, LOCATION","106, 113, TRIGGER"}
9483	9) The authors used dichloromethane in one of the case studies. It is considered to be highly toxic and undesirable in API manufacturing and thus the authors should point this out and mention that it is only used as a last resort (Chem. Rev., 2015, 115(16), 8182–8229).	{"141, 146, TRIGGER","158, 165, MODAL","165, 179, ACTION","184, 192, ACTION","158, 164, MODAL","197, 268, CONTENT"}
9484	10) Low solvent consumption is claimed by the authors (line 182). If possible to calculate it would be informative for the readers to add the actual solvent consumption as m3 solvent per kg purified product for all case studies.	{"134, 138, ACTION","94, 99, MODAL","55, 63, LOCATION","66, 69, TRIGGER","138, 227, CONTENT","94, 99, MODAL","55, 63, LOCATION"}
9485	12) How many times is it worth to do the racemization? In other words, after each enantiomer separation the undesired enantiomer goes under racemization and then recirculated back to the enantiomer separation process. It would be useful information for the readers to learn how many times this process is repeated  in the industry, and at the end of the entire process what is the desired/undesired enantiomer ratio.	{"369, 374, TRIGGER","221, 227, MODAL","229, 313, ACTION","4, 13, TRIGGER","4, 7, TRIGGER","221, 226, MODAL","274, 330, CONTENT","13, 53, CONTENT","377, 415, CONTENT"}
9486	13) Section 3 title should read Conclusions and not Discussion. In this subsection could add some final thoughts about the main industrial challenges of enantiomer separation? What are the main challenges nowadays that should be addressed  on order to increase profit and sustainability of enantiomer separation?	{"119, 174, CONTENT","4, 19, LOCATION","176, 180, TRIGGER","52, 62, LOCATION","229, 240, ACTION","219, 226, MODAL","185, 213, CONTENT","176, 181, TRIGGER","72, 82, LOCATION","252, 311, CONTENT","32, 44, CONTENT","20, 27, MODAL","83, 89, MODAL","4, 13, LOCATION","83, 92, ACTION","20, 26, MODAL","89, 92, ACTION"}
9487	The manuscript entitled“Vitamin D concentration in maternal and umbilical cord blood by season.

9489	General: The manuscript preparation should be corrected  carefully. Especially the references preparation is extremely shabby – it should be prepared  according to the recommendations, without any underlining, the articles published in Polish should be indicated as published  in Polish, etc.	{"79, 105, CONTENT","9, 35, CONTENT","151, 208, CONTENT","210, 242, CONTENT","36, 43, MODAL","131, 138, MODAL","141, 151, ACTION","36, 42, MODAL","243, 250, MODAL","253, 263, ACTION","13, 23, LOCATION","45, 55, ACTION","46, 57, ACTION"}
9490	Title: The second part of the title suggests, that the sun exposure was measured (either using the typical devices to measure the exposure, or using the daily record of exposure), while the lack of indicated assessment is one of the major limitations of the study. Authors should not indicate it in the title, as they did not analyse the influence of the sun exposure, but rather only supplements in various seasons.	{"0, 5, LOCATION","30, 35, LOCATION","273, 279, MODAL","369, 372, TRIGGER","369, 373, TRIGGER","299, 308, LOCATION","11, 35, LOCATION","51, 178, CONTENT","284, 292, ACTION","273, 283, MODAL"}
9491	Abstract: Authors should avoid casual style (e.g.“Is it still true?”) and present only the most important results and conclusions of their study, as well as all the methodological aspects, that are needed.	{"82, 204, CONTENT","31, 43, CONTENT","25, 31, ACTION","49, 68, LOCATION","74, 82, ACTION","49, 68, LOCATION","18, 30, ACTION","18, 25, MODAL","0, 8, LOCATION"}
9492	Introduction: The multiple references should be avoided , especially if in one simple sentence, Authors present a large number of references (typically four or five). Moreover, Authors should remove irrelevant references, not associated with the indicated issue. Serious problem is also a large number of Polish references – articles inaccessible in the electronic version, or even published in Polish (not possible to read for reader from countries other than Poland), published in some minor Polish journals without IF (it is unknown if they are published in scientific peer-review journals or are just a popular ones). The articles published in Polish, especially review articles (e.g. 15), or publications too old to be available online (e.g. 16) should be removed / or replaced by other references.	{"18, 37, CONTENT","0, 12, LOCATION","167, 175, TRIGGER","38, 45, MODAL","167, 175, TRIGGER","192, 199, ACTION","86, 94, LOCATION","47, 55, ACTION","48, 56, ACTION","289, 322, CONTENT","751, 758, MODAL","761, 769, ACTION","774, 783, ACTION","185, 192, MODAL","38, 44, MODAL","622, 750, CONTENT","199, 261, CONTENT","771, 773, TRIGGER"}
9493	Authors must understand, that the issue of vitamin D deficiency is the problem universal for many countries, analysed worldwide – they should indicate Polish references only in the case of Polish studies, but also they should include references published in journals more available for international readers.	{"151, 203, CONTENT","142, 151, ACTION","234, 307, CONTENT","226, 234, ACTION","219, 226, MODAL","205, 209, TRIGGER","219, 233, ACTION","8, 12, MODAL","205, 208, TRIGGER","135, 142, MODAL"}

9498	Statistical analysis: It is not indicated if the normality of distribution was tested. If distribution is different than normal, rather median with min and max values should be presented , instead of mean/ mean and SD.	{"136, 166, CONTENT","167, 173, MODAL","177, 187, ACTION","87, 90, TRIGGER","167, 174, MODAL","0, 20, LOCATION","176, 186, ACTION","200, 217, CONTENT","188, 199, TRIGGER"}
9500	Discussion: The discussion is very superficial. Authors are not trying to find the reasons of observed situation and conclusions, but they present some data not related to their own study. Due to the fact, that vitamin D intake and status is related to the diet and sun exposure, the studies conducted in the geographical proximity rather than those conducted in Greece and Norway should be indicated . The sun exposure in Greece and Norway is different than in Poland, but what about the diet – is the diet in Poland similar as in Greece or Norway? The indicated vitamin D intake is very low – is it typical for Polish young women? What about other studies conducted in this group? Is it specific only for pregnant women? All the indicated limitations of the study should be discussed and it should be indicated what is the possible influence of them on the observed  results.	{"683, 721, CONTENT","550, 631, CONTENT","280, 381, CONTENT","813, 876, CONTENT","723, 765, CONTENT","793, 800, MODAL","0, 10, LOCATION","803, 813, ACTION","381, 387, MODAL","474, 548, CONTENT","644, 681, CONTENT","633, 637, TRIGGER","130, 134, TRIGGER","16, 26, LOCATION","390, 400, ACTION","130, 133, TRIGGER","16, 27, LOCATION","776, 786, ACTION","381, 388, MODAL","391, 401, ACTION","470, 474, TRIGGER","766, 773, MODAL"}
9502	The manuscript entitled“Effects of vitamin D supplementation on haematological values and muscle recovery in elite male traditional rowers” presents interesting issue, but some important corrections are necessary.	{"23, 139, LOCATION","4, 14, LOCATION","168, 172, TRIGGER","4, 14, LOCATION","168, 171, TRIGGER"}

9506	In both cases the diet was improperly balanced and Authors in fact assessed the effect of vitamin D supplementation in the case of deficiency ones. It is confirmed by a high frequency of deficiency in a groups (Table 1). It does not correspond the aim of the study, as it was not specified, that Authors planned to generate a deficiency of assessed nutrient.	{"211, 218, LOCATION","211, 218, LOCATION"}

9510	It seems, that Authors are not native English speakers (lack of English words but using Spanish ones – e.g.“hidroxivitamina”, improper verbs – e.g.“levels was” – line 38) – the manuscript should be corrected  by native English speaker or preferably by the professional agency.	{"188, 195, MODAL","147, 159, LOCATION","107, 124, LOCATION","107, 124, LOCATION","197, 207, ACTION","188, 194, MODAL","78, 81, TRIGGER","162, 169, LOCATION","198, 209, ACTION","78, 82, TRIGGER","177, 187, LOCATION"}

10102	§   I have noticed that the“Materials and Methods” section that should offer abundant details regarding the method devised by the authors while in the same time should be concisely presenting and citing  widely known methods, is replaced within the manuscript by the section number 2 entitled "2. The  noise-perturbed Mandelbrot map ". I strongly believe that before proceeding to present the very important elements of their devised approach in the“Materials and Methods” section that must provide the precise details concerning  the authors’ conducted research in order to assure its reproducibility, a good starting point consists in modifying the title of the actual section 2 as the“Materials and Methods” section.	{"486, 490, MODAL","77, 137, CONTENT","248, 259, LOCATION","138, 143, TRIGGER","71, 77, ACTION","161, 167, MODAL","181, 191, ACTION","196, 202, ACTION","204, 224, CONTENT","267, 283, LOCATION","293, 334, LOCATION","490, 498, ACTION","498, 601, CONTENT","637, 646, ACTION","27, 58, LOCATION","449, 480, LOCATION","687, 718, LOCATION","64, 70, MODAL","646, 656, CONTENT","671, 680, LOCATION"}

10106	Ø  Comments regarding the "Discussion" section:	{"26, 46, LOCATION"}
10108	§   In the“Discussion” section it will benefit to examine, to debate the registered results and the way how they can be regarded with prospects to preceding researches that have targeted  similar goals. Unfortunately, in the current form of the manuscript under review this discussion, this debate does not exist. The authors must address these important aspects in order to be able to pin point exactly the clear advancement that their conducted study from the manuscript has made to the current body of knowledge.	{"331, 338, ACTION","286, 297, CONTENT","245, 255, LOCATION","69, 201, CONTENT","338, 362, CONTENT","326, 330, MODAL","34, 38, MODAL","62, 68, ACTION","50, 57, ACTION","298, 312, ACTION","10, 30, LOCATION"}
10109	§   It is in the“Discussion” section where the authors should underline both the advantages and disadvantages of their proposed approach when compared with other valuable studies from the current state of art.	{"72, 208, CONTENT","62, 71, ACTION","55, 61, MODAL","16, 36, LOCATION"}
10110	§   It will increase the value of the article if the authors mention in this section if they have tried other approaches before reaching the current developed method from the manuscript and what did the results reveal that determined them to devise the current form of their method.	{"7, 11, MODAL","84, 281, CONTENT","11, 20, ACTION","21, 45, CONTENT","61, 68, ACTION","72, 84, LOCATION"}
10111	§   The“Discussion” section is also a very suitable place for the authors to emphasize not only the novel aspects and strong points of their developed method, but also to point out objectively the existing limits of their method, possible circumstances that will hinder their method’s effectiveness and state clear and accurate directions they will pursue in their future research activities in order to extend the current research and overcome the existing  limitations.	{"7, 27, LOCATION","159, 162, TRIGGER","258, 262, MODAL","303, 308, ACTION","77, 86, ACTION","171, 180, ACTION","309, 391, CONTENT","403, 410, ACTION","411, 431, CONTENT","87, 95, TRIGGER","96, 157, CONTENT","193, 252, CONTENT","436, 444, ACTION","449, 470, CONTENT"}
10112	§   First of all, I have noticed that the authors have chosen to entitle the section "Conclusion" but obviously, the section depicts more than one conclusion. Therefore, the title "Conclusions" is more suitable (just like the official Symmetry MDPI Journal's Template recommends)	{"194, 210, ACTION","159, 168, TRIGGER","117, 125, LOCATION","77, 97, LOCATION","170, 193, CONTENT","125, 132, ACTION","133, 157, CONTENT","98, 101, TRIGGER"}
10113	§   If the above-mentioned aspects from the review report are implemented by the authors, this means the paper will have included a very well-structured Introduction and a correctly structured abstract, therefore the authors should not repeat any part from the Introduction in the Conclusion section. The authors should not restate (like they did in the current form of the manuscript) what they have done or what the article does, they should focus instead on what they have discovered and most important on what their findings mean.	{"458, 486, CONTENT","324, 331, ACTION","313, 323, MODAL","506, 533, CONTENT","62, 73, ACTION","121, 129, ACTION","281, 299, LOCATION","261, 273, LOCATION","193, 201, LOCATION","172, 192, CONTENT","386, 431, CONTENT","132, 152, CONTENT","111, 115, MODAL","243, 252, CONTENT","236, 242, ACTION","225, 235, MODAL","153, 165, LOCATION","437, 443, MODAL","443, 449, ACTION"}

10115	§   The authors should write a short Conclusion section, in fact they should conclude in just a few sentences given the rich discussion section they will have developed in the body of the paper. I recommend the authors to overcome the temptation to repeat material from the Introduction or from the rest of the paper only to make the Conclusion longer under the false belief that a longer Conclusion section will seem more impressive.	{"89, 109, CONTENT","16, 22, MODAL","30, 55, CONTENT","222, 230, ACTION","125, 143, LOCATION","149, 153, MODAL","249, 351, CONTENT","23, 28, ACTION","70, 76, MODAL","76, 85, ACTION"}
10116	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: energies-378797, having the title "Development and Validation of a Thermo-Economic Model for Design Optimisation and Off-Design Performance Evaluation of a Pure Solar Microturbine". In this paper, the authors aim to develop and validate using an object-oriented programming approach, a thermo-economic model in view of optimizing and assessing the design and off-design performance of microturbine-based solar power plants. I consider that the paper will benefit if the following aspects are addressed within the manuscript:	{"527, 536, ACTION","69, 215, LOCATION","548, 558, LOCATION","505, 522, CONTENT","20, 30, LOCATION"}
10117	The sections of the manuscript in its actual form are not according to the ones recommended by the Energies MDPI Journal's Template. The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the above-mentioned template that provides a more logical structure, which is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to better express the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review must be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5. Conclusions (not mandatory), 6. Patents (not mandatory), Supplementary Materials (not mandatory), Author Contributions, Funding, Acknowledgments, Conflicts of Interest, Appendices and References.	{"385, 389, ACTION","564, 568, MODAL","572, 584, ACTION","597, 885, CONTENT","4, 30, LOCATION","183, 195, ACTION","293, 337, CONTENT","375, 379, MODAL","402, 520, CONTENT","161, 165, MODAL","284, 289, TRIGGER","137, 147, LOCATION","540, 550, LOCATION","364, 374, LOCATION","196, 282, CONTENT"}
10118	In the "Abstract" of the paper, the authors must present in a clearer manner the following  aspects: the background, the methods, the main findings, the conclusions, as in the actual form of the manuscript, the abstract offers information related only to some of these aspects and even so, their delimitation is unclear. In addition to this, in the abstract the authors should briefly state the novelty of their proposed approach.	{"101, 206, CONTENT","48, 56, ACTION","370, 376, MODAL","7, 17, LOCATION","391, 429, CONTENT","385, 390, ACTION","349, 357, LOCATION","44, 48, MODAL"}
10119	In the "Introduction" section, the authors must pin point an exact deficiency, an unsolved problem, a gap that still exists in the current body of knowledge that needs to be filled, therefore justifying the need and novelty of their study. After having declared the novel aspects of their proposed approach, at the end of the Introduction, the authors must present the structure of their paper under the form: "The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 contains…".	{"47, 57, ACTION","7, 29, LOCATION","182, 191, TRIGGER","203, 238, CONTENT","357, 364, ACTION","43, 47, MODAL","365, 479, CONTENT","192, 202, ACTION","352, 356, MODAL","308, 338, LOCATION","57, 180, CONTENT"}
10120	In order to bring a benefit to the manuscript, the authors should state and justify very clear in the "Materials and Methods" section, preferably within the first paragraph, the choices they have made when developing the final form of their proposed approach. The authors should state what has justified using  the object-oriented programming technique, what is special, unexpected, or different in their research methodology. It will benefit if the authors mention if they have tried other approaches that in the end led them to the current form of their research design.	{"66, 71, ACTION","76, 83, ACTION","102, 133, LOCATION","272, 278, MODAL","279, 284, ACTION","285, 352, CONTENT","353, 369, CONTENT","371, 381, CONTENT","386, 425, CONTENT","458, 465, ACTION","469, 572, CONTENT","430, 434, MODAL","35, 45, LOCATION","174, 258, CONTENT","157, 172, LOCATION","59, 65, MODAL"}
10121	The equations within the manuscript should be explained , demonstrated or cited, as there are some equations that have not been introduced in the literature for the first time by the authors and that are not cited.	{"74, 79, ACTION","58, 70, ACTION","25, 35, LOCATION","36, 42, MODAL","45, 55, ACTION","94, 214, CONTENT","0, 13, CONTENT"}
10123	In order to be able to verify the correctness of the very important validations of the individual components that the authors state that they have performed against experimental data available in the literature, in the supplementary materials the authors must provide all the necessary details in order to allow other researchers to verify, reproduce, discuss and extend the obtained scientific results based on the obtained published results. Other researchers should not have to obtain and concatenate the data sets from various sources, risking in acquiring different datasets or datasets that have been normalized differently than the datasets on which the authors have performed their experimental tests and validations. The exact datasets that the authors have used when running the experimental tests and most importantly the validation process will be a valuable addition to the manuscript if they can be provided  as supplementary materials to the manuscript as the authors must provide all the necessary details in order to allow other researchers to verify, reproduce, discuss and extend the obtained published results of the authors.	{"852, 856, MODAL","23, 29, ACTION","255, 259, MODAL","268, 293, CONTENT","957, 967, LOCATION","996, 1021, CONTENT","860, 879, CONTENT","219, 242, LOCATION","30, 210, CONTENT","260, 267, ACTION","857, 859, ACTION","906, 909, MODAL","913, 921, ACTION","926, 949, LOCATION","983, 987, MODAL","988, 995, ACTION","726, 852, CONTENT"}
10124	In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Discussion" section (that for the time being is missing completely from the manuscript), the authors should make a comparison between their designed proposed approach and other similar ones that have been designed and described in the literature for similar or related purposes. The authors should also highlight current limitations of their study, and briefly mention some precise directions that they intend to follow in their future research work.	{"12, 20, ACTION","25, 53, CONTENT","171, 175, ACTION","366, 375, ACTION","354, 360, MODAL","176, 340, CONTENT","164, 170, MODAL","111, 118, ACTION","376, 410, CONTENT","424, 431, ACTION","437, 512, CONTENT","62, 82, LOCATION","139, 149, LOCATION"}
10125	After having written a proper "Discussion" section the authors should conclude their manuscript without restating  the results that they have already presented within the manuscript once again, instead they should conclude their study by pin pointing  in the manuscript what they have discovered and most important of all, what their findings mean to the scientific community.	{"63, 69, MODAL","207, 213, MODAL","214, 222, ACTION","96, 192, CONTENT","70, 78, ACTION","270, 375, CONTENT","259, 269, LOCATION","238, 250, CONTENT","85, 95, LOCATION","30, 50, LOCATION"}
10126	In addition to the above-mentioned issues, the authors must perform a thorough editing  of their manuscript in order to achieve a proper readable paper. I am providing a few nonlimitative examples out of the many others that must be addresses within the manuscript:	{"67, 86, CONTENT","55, 59, MODAL","97, 107, LOCATION","233, 242, ACTION","225, 229, MODAL","168, 196, CONTENT","254, 264, LOCATION","60, 67, ACTION"}

10134	I have reviewed the manuscript "An assessment of the econometric studies on the development of renewable energy sources to support the EU 2020-2030 climate and energy framework", Manuscript ID: sustainability-753952 that has been submitted for publication in the MDPI Sustainability Journal and I have identified a series of aspects that in my opinion must be addressed  in order to bring a benefit to the manuscript.	{"31, 177, LOCATION","313, 332, CONTENT","20, 31, LOCATION","352, 356, MODAL","359, 369, ACTION","406, 416, LOCATION"}
10135	I consider that the article will benefit if the authors take into account the following  remarks and addresses within the manuscript the signaled issues:	{"122, 132, LOCATION","132, 152, CONTENT","28, 32, MODAL","33, 41, ACTION","55, 60, ACTION","101, 110, ACTION","60, 96, CONTENT"}
10137	Remark 2. The type of the paper. As mentioned before, due to its content, the Manuscript ID: sustainability-753952 is more suitable of becoming a "review" article type. Besides declaring their manuscript as a "review" article, the authors should emphasize more in the manuscript, along with the elements already presented, the main search engines, the approach that they have used in developing their study and the type of their review (for example: Rapid Review, Scientific Literature (Narrative) Review, Systematic Review, Scoping Review, Mixed Methods Review, Network Meta-Analysis, Overview of Reviews, Meta-Syntheses, Integrative Review, Diagnostic Test Accuracy Review or Living Systematic Review).	{"239, 245, MODAL","323, 703, CONTENT","268, 278, LOCATION","144, 167, CONTENT","115, 143, ACTION","177, 186, ACTION","193, 225, CONTENT","246, 255, ACTION","78, 88, LOCATION"}
10138	Remark 3, the Title of the manuscript, "An assessment of the econometric studies on the development of renewable energy sources to support the EU 2020-2030 climate and energy framework.". First of all, the acronyms must be avoided  in the title, even if they are widely known. Regarding the other acronyms used in the manuscript, they should be explained the first time when they are introduced . Secondly, as the title of the paper is not a sentence, one should not use a period at its end. Thirdly, I would like the authors to comment in the paper whether the studies published previously (in the period 2002-2019) are still relevant today, in 2020 and in the next years up to 2030 in what concerns the same problem, taking into account that (according to the title of the paper), the authors have declared that their paper represents "An assessment […] to support the EU 2020-2030 climate and energy framework". The authors should provide explanations whether their study is consistent, whether the changes that may occur within the older analyses from the above-mentioned period and the targeted period 2020-2030 risk altering the final result. In addition, the title should reflect the fact that the article is a review, for example under the form "An assessment of the econometric studies on the development of renewable energy sources to support the EU 2020-2030 climate and energy framework – a review".	{"1178, 1186, ACTION","39, 186, LOCATION","202, 214, CONTENT","287, 328, CONTENT","335, 341, MODAL","471, 490, CONTENT","410, 450, CONTENT","529, 536, ACTION","549, 719, CONTENT","927, 933, MODAL","933, 941, ACTION","1172, 1178, MODAL","14, 19, LOCATION","222, 230, ACTION","215, 219, MODAL","1187, 1410, CONTENT","1166, 1171, LOCATION","942, 1147, CONTENT","837, 913, LOCATION","544, 549, LOCATION","467, 470, ACTION","456, 466, MODAL","355, 394, CONTENT","345, 354, ACTION","239, 244, LOCATION"}
10139	Remark 4, the "Materials and Methods" section. In order to help the readers better understand the methodology of the conducted study, in the "Materials and Methods" section, the authors should devise a flowchart that depicts the steps that they have processed in developing  their research and most important of all, the final target. This flowchart will facilitate the understanding of the proposed approach and it will make the article more interesting  to the reader if used as a graphical abstract.	{"420, 425, ACTION","335, 349, CONTENT","416, 420, MODAL","426, 501, CONTENT","350, 354, MODAL","366, 408, CONTENT","355, 365, ACTION","200, 333, CONTENT","141, 172, LOCATION","14, 45, LOCATION","186, 192, MODAL","193, 199, ACTION"}
10140	Remark 5, the "Discussion and concluding remarks" section. In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in this section, the authors should make a comparison between their approach from the manuscript and other similar ones that have been developed and used in the literature for the same or related purposes. There are a lot of valuable studies in the scientific literature related to the subject of the manuscript to which the authors can compare to and this comparison will highlight even more the insights that their paper has brought in contrast to the existing   studies.	{"117, 129, LOCATION","451, 458, ACTION","466, 481, CONTENT","482, 486, MODAL","80, 112, CONTENT","507, 586, CONTENT","14, 57, LOCATION","150, 154, ACTION","447, 450, MODAL","155, 318, CONTENT","320, 429, CONTENT","429, 434, TRIGGER","143, 149, MODAL","487, 496, ACTION","71, 79, ACTION"}
10141	Remark 6, the "Discussion and concluding remarks" section.

10142	Remark 7, the "Discussion and concluding remarks" section. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their analysis and provide an insight at the end of this section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained results, the most important, appropriate and concrete actions that the decisional factors and all the involved parties should take in order to benefit from the results of the research conducted within the manuscript as to attain the ultimate goal of sustainability.	{"390, 394, ACTION","113, 117, ACTION","383, 389, MODAL","273, 383, CONTENT","118, 155, CONTENT","85, 89, MODAL","160, 167, ACTION","179, 205, LOCATION","216, 220, TRIGGER","167, 179, CONTENT","469, 479, LOCATION","14, 57, LOCATION","404, 457, CONTENT"}
10143	Remark 8, the "Discussion and concluding remarks" section. The authors should highlight whether, or to what extent they have managed to address the necessity identified within the "Introduction" section. In this section the authors must present in a clearer manner the learnings and insights of their research, as obtained after having performed the review, the main themes that emerge from their review.	{"88, 95, TRIGGER","97, 99, TRIGGER","108, 157, CONTENT","180, 202, LOCATION","207, 219, LOCATION","245, 403, CONTENT","71, 77, MODAL","103, 107, TRIGGER","14, 57, LOCATION","78, 87, ACTION","232, 236, MODAL","237, 244, ACTION"}
10144	Remark 9. The references used within the manuscript. I have noticed that many references from the authors' study are review articles. I understand perfectly that review articles are a source of good information for a literature review, but most of the review papers that the authors have cited and used when devising what it should have been their own critical review of the existing state of knowledge already contain a certain amount of bias arising  from the critical review that the authors of the respective cited papers have performed in their own review articles. Consequently, I consider that the manuscript will benefit if the authors extend this section by reviewing , in addition to the existing review articles from the manuscript, an increased number of scientific articles that brought contributions to the current state of knowledge from the multiple relevant ones that exist in the scientific literature related to the article's topic, and the authors must review this articles critically from their own perspectives, not from the perspectives of other review articles. There are a lot of valuable studies in the scientific literature that can be easily accessed  and that the authors can review, this review will highlight even more the personal insights and aspects that the manuscript brings in contrast to other existing  review articles.	{"1086, 1201, CONTENT","10, 24, CONTENT","25, 29, ACTION","1225, 1229, MODAL","968, 972, MODAL","236, 239, TRIGGER","664, 950, CONTENT","605, 615, LOCATION","972, 979, ACTION","650, 663, LOCATION","643, 650, ACTION","980, 1084, CONTENT","1229, 1239, ACTION","616, 620, MODAL","1201, 1204, MODAL","1205, 1211, ACTION","1245, 1358, CONTENT","41, 51, LOCATION"}
10145	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: mathematics-486936, with the title "Memes evolution in a memetic variant of Particle Swarm Optimization". In this paper, the authors propose a Coevolving Memetic PSO algorithm (CoMPSO) for numerical optimization that allows to evolve local search operators in the form of memes. I consider that the article will benefit if the authors address within the manuscript the following  aspects:	{"70, 139, LOCATION","342, 346, MODAL","370, 377, ACTION","334, 342, LOCATION","389, 399, LOCATION","400, 422, CONTENT","20, 30, LOCATION"}
10147	Ø Lines 1-9, the "Abstract" of the paper. Taking into consideration that this is a research article, the abstract should offer a relevant overview of the work. It will benefit the paper if the authors provide a structured abstract, that covers the following aspects: the background (in which the authors should place the issue that the manuscript addresses in a broad context and highlight the purpose of the study), the methods used to solve the identified issue (that should be briefly described ), a summary of the article's main findings followed by the main conclusions or interpretations. In the abstract the authors must also declare and briefly justify the novelty of their work.	{"2, 11, LOCATION","661, 686, CONTENT","652, 660, ACTION","633, 640, ACTION","623, 627, MODAL","17, 27, LOCATION","105, 113, LOCATION","163, 167, MODAL","209, 593, CONTENT","602, 610, LOCATION","201, 208, ACTION","126, 158, CONTENT","121, 126, ACTION","114, 120, MODAL"}
10148	Ø Lines 12-21, the "Introduction" section. "Over the years, a class of hybrid EAs, called memetic algorithms (MAs), have been widely applied for many complex optimization problems, such as scheduling problems [1–3], combinatorial optimization problems [4–6], multi-objective optimization problems [7,8] and multimodal optimization problems [9,10]. Population based evolutionary approaches, such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs) or Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), are able to detect in a fast way the main regions of attraction while their local search abilities represent a major drawback [11] from the point of view of the solution accuracy and of the convergence behaviour, specially when applied to multimodal problems. Memetic Algorithms (MAs) [12] have recently received a great attention as effective meta-heuristics to improve generic Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) schemes by combining these latter with local search procedures [11,13]." I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 13 (like the authors have did) or even more scientific works in a few lines just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section. In this section, the authors must introduce a presentation of the current state of the research field by reviewing it carefully and by citing key publications. By doing so, the problem will be put into context and it will benefit the readers as well. The purpose of the literature survey is to highlight for each of the involved referenced papers the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the method used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article. This is the only way to contextualize the current state of the art in which the authors of the manuscript position their paper and address aspects that have not been tackled/solved yet by the existing studies.	{"1354, 1357, ACTION","1914, 1983, CONTENT","19, 41, LOCATION","1190, 1194, MODAL","1464, 1774, CONTENT","1906, 1913, ACTION","960, 978, ACTION","1813, 1841, CONTENT","1799, 1812, ACTION","1870, 1880, LOCATION","1412, 1448, CONTENT","1455, 1464, ACTION","2, 13, LOCATION","1205, 1319, CONTENT","1164, 1176, LOCATION","1195, 1204, ACTION","987, 997, LOCATION","1334, 1345, CONTENT","1345, 1351, MODAL","1357, 1411, CONTENT","42, 940, LOCATION","1140, 1159, LOCATION","998, 1082, CONTENT"}
10149	Ø The "Materials and Methods" section. According to the MDPI Mathematics Journal's Template, it is recommended that a research paper contain, among other sections, a "Materials and Methods" one. In the actual form of the manuscript this section is partially replaced by the actual sections 2 and 3. The authors should take into consideration to restructure these sections in order to provide the details required by the "Materials and Methods" section, as recommended by the Journal's Template. In the "Materials and Methods" section, the new developed methods should be described  in detail while well-established methods (and information) can be briefly described and appropriately cited . In order to help the readers better understand the methodology of the conducted study, in the "Materials and Methods" section, the authors should devise a flowchart that depicts the steps that they have processed in developing  their research and most important of all, the final target. This flowchart will facilitate the understanding of the proposed approach and in the same time will make the article more interesting  to the readers if used as a graphical abstract. In addition to flowchart, in order to bring a benefit to the manuscript, the authors should state and justify very clear in the "Materials and Methods" section the choices they have made when developing the final form of their proposed approach. The authors should state what has justified using  this approach, what is special, unexpected, or different in their research methodology. It will benefit if the authors mention if they have tried other approaches that in the end led them to the current form of their research design. In order to provide all the necessary details for assuring the reproducibility of the study, I consider that the detailed hardware and software configurations that were used when developing experiments should be specified .	{"1080, 1084, ACTION","221, 231, LOCATION","258, 266, ACTION","232, 244, LOCATION","592, 597, TRIGGER","598, 640, CONTENT","1248, 1254, MODAL","1011, 1053, CONTENT","1075, 1079, MODAL","656, 665, ACTION","571, 580, ACTION","535, 560, CONTENT","1323, 1407, CONTENT","831, 837, MODAL","1551, 1555, MODAL","786, 818, LOCATION","392, 493, CONTENT","1255, 1260, ACTION","1265, 1272, ACTION","640, 644, MODAL","345, 356, ACTION","980, 994, CONTENT","6, 37, LOCATION","581, 591, CONTENT","683, 691, ACTION","311, 317, MODAL","1803, 1896, CONTENT","1896, 1902, MODAL","1587, 1693, CONTENT","1579, 1586, ACTION","1434, 1547, CONTENT","1428, 1433, ACTION","1421, 1427, MODAL","1291, 1322, LOCATION","1906, 1915, ACTION","844, 980, CONTENT","561, 567, MODAL","502, 535, LOCATION","995, 999, MODAL","1000, 1010, ACTION","384, 391, ACTION","281, 298, LOCATION","357, 371, LOCATION","838, 844, ACTION","1097, 1163, CONTENT"}
10150	Ø The equations within the manuscript should be explained , demonstrated or cited, as there are some equations that have not been introduced in the literature for the first time by the authors and that are not cited.	{"75, 81, ACTION","60, 72, ACTION","2, 15, CONTENT","202, 215, ACTION","47, 57, ACTION","27, 37, LOCATION","96, 110, CONTENT","116, 140, ACTION","38, 44, MODAL","141, 177, CONTENT"}
10151	Ø The "Discussion" section. After having analyzed the results, the authors should move forward to the "Discussion" section. In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Discussion" section (which is currently missing from the manuscript), the authors should make a comparison between their approach from the manuscript and other similar ones that have been developed in the literature for the same or related purposes. In the manuscript, the authors state: at Line 44: "The approach is similar to the one presented in [20]."; at Line 230: "Note that, a similar idea is present in [20]."; at Line 279: "This technique is inspired to an our previous work [20]". Therefore, one can conclude that the authors have succeeded in establishing  a precedence in their line of research on the topic of Particle Swarm Optimization schemes (actually, just one of the three authors of the Manuscript ID: mathematics-486936 has been also author of the cited paper [20] which has two authors). Consequently, I consider that the manuscript under review will benefit a lot if the authors highlight in the discussion section how their research has evolved from the findings of the previous study that has been published by one of the 3 authors of the current manuscript to the present research results reported in the current manuscript. In my opinion, comparing the approach and the results from the paper under review with the ones from the cited paper [20], is a very important and relevant aspect.	{"444, 454, LOCATION","1106, 1124, LOCATION","1089, 1098, ACTION","619, 676, LOCATION","608, 617, LOCATION","556, 604, LOCATION","547, 555, LOCATION","487, 542, LOCATION","478, 485, LOCATION","281, 436, CONTENT","276, 280, ACTION","269, 275, MODAL","186, 206, LOCATION","28, 61, CONTENT","81, 94, ACTION","6, 28, LOCATION","102, 122, LOCATION","244, 254, LOCATION","1031, 1041, LOCATION","1055, 1059, MODAL","1326, 1336, LOCATION","1125, 1301, CONTENT","208, 213, TRIGGER","75, 81, MODAL","227, 234, ACTION"}
10152	Ø The "Discussion" section. In the "Discussion" section the authors should also highlight current limitations of their study, and briefly mention some precise directions that they intend to follow in their future research work. The paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their approach and provide an insight at the end of the "Discussion" section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained outcomes, the most important and useful results of their research, the usefulness and applicability of their memetic variant of Particle Swarm Optimization.	{"89, 124, CONTENT","35, 55, LOCATION","80, 89, ACTION","6, 26, LOCATION","371, 584, CONTENT","238, 242, MODAL","321, 331, CONTENT","313, 320, ACTION","68, 74, MODAL","271, 308, CONTENT","266, 270, ACTION","332, 370, LOCATION","138, 145, ACTION","150, 226, CONTENT"}
10153	Ø The authors should pay more attention to the spelling , grammar and style as several errors have occurred, for example, at Line 5: "Moreover, an hybrid continuous…" instead of "Moreover, a hybrid continuous…"; at Line 18: "…specially when applied to multimodal problems…" instead of "…especially when applied to multimodal problems…"; Line 105: "…is an hybrid algorithm…" instead of "…is a hybrid algorithm…"; Line 279: "This technique is inspired to an our previous work…" instead of "This technique is inspired from our previous work…".

10154	Ø Line 12: "Over the years, a class of hybrid EAs…" Even if they are widely known in the scientific community, the acronyms should be explained  the first time when they appear in the manuscript, for example, in the mentioned case, under the form: "Over the years, a class of hybrid Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs)…".	{"111, 124, CONTENT","2, 9, LOCATION","124, 130, MODAL","11, 51, LOCATION","184, 194, LOCATION","248, 314, CONTENT","133, 143, ACTION","144, 176, CONTENT"}
10155	After having assessed the suitability for publication of the Manuscript ID: symmetry-467680, having the title "Analytical solutions of fractional Klein-Gordon and Gas Dynamics equations, via (G'/G)-expansion method", I have distinguished several elements that from my point of view should be made less confused  and more comprehensible by the authors in view of improving the quality of the manuscript. Therefore, I have devised and wrote the following comments to the authors of the manuscript under review:	{"292, 296, ACTION","391, 401, LOCATION","484, 494, LOCATION","282, 288, MODAL","61, 71, LOCATION","110, 215, LOCATION","297, 335, CONTENT","403, 412, TRIGGER"}
10156	The authors have conducted a research having as a main goal the development of an analytical technique in view of solving the Klein-Gordon and Gas Dynamics fractional equations. The article under review will be improved  if the authors address the following aspects in the text of the manuscript:	{"273, 277, LOCATION","203, 207, MODAL","244, 265, CONTENT","210, 219, ACTION","284, 295, LOCATION","182, 189, LOCATION","236, 243, ACTION"}

10158	§   The Main Strong Point: The manuscript under review approaches a very interesting topic for the experts in the field.	{"31, 41, LOCATION"}
10159	§   The Main Weak Point:  I consider that the main weak point consists in the structure of the manuscript. If the authors make an effort to improve the structure of the manuscript and complement it with the recommendations from the specific comments, the authors will arrive at an article that can bring  a valuable insight to the current state of knowledge.	{"263, 267, MODAL","42, 87, CONTENT","140, 147, ACTION","148, 161, CONTENT","169, 179, LOCATION","184, 194, ACTION","198, 249, CONTENT","268, 274, ACTION","294, 297, MODAL","95, 105, LOCATION","297, 303, ACTION","305, 358, CONTENT"}

10163	Ø  Comments concerning the "Abstract" section of the paper:	{"27, 45, LOCATION"}
10164	§  The manuscript will benefit if the authors provide a structured abstract, that covers the following aspects: the background (in which the authors should place the issue that the manuscript addresses in a broad context and highlight the purpose of the study), the methods used to solve the identified issue (that should be briefly described ), a summary of the article's main findings followed by the main conclusions or interpretations. In the abstract the authors must also declare and briefly justify the novelty of their work. The authors must present in a clearer manner the above-mentioned aspects: the background, the methods, the main findings, the conclusions, as in the actual form of the manuscript, the abstract offers information related only to some of these aspects and even so, their delimitation is unclear.	{"468, 472, MODAL","700, 711, LOCATION","717, 725, LOCATION","346, 438, CONTENT","262, 308, CONTENT","7, 17, LOCATION","18, 22, MODAL","53, 126, CONTENT","45, 53, ACTION","149, 155, MODAL","156, 161, ACTION","162, 201, CONTENT","225, 234, ACTION","234, 259, CONTENT","315, 321, MODAL","333, 342, ACTION","447, 455, LOCATION","478, 485, ACTION","498, 505, ACTION","505, 531, CONTENT","545, 549, MODAL","550, 557, ACTION","578, 671, CONTENT"}
10165	Ø  Comments regarding the "Introduction" section:	{"26, 48, LOCATION"}
10166	§  In the "Introduction" section, the authors should state clearly the motivation for the work presented in the manuscript and prepare the readers for the structure of the paper. The authors should address the context, need, task, and finally they should detail the subsequent structuring  of the paper.	{"205, 230, CONTENT","67, 104, CONTENT","53, 59, ACTION","262, 302, CONTENT","46, 52, MODAL","191, 197, MODAL","255, 262, ACTION","10, 32, LOCATION","112, 122, LOCATION","198, 205, ACTION","248, 254, MODAL","146, 177, CONTENT","127, 134, ACTION"}
10167	§  First, the authors should provide some context in order to guide the readers who are less familiar with the approached topic and to establish the importance of their work.	{"37, 127, CONTENT","29, 36, ACTION","135, 144, ACTION","144, 173, CONTENT","22, 28, MODAL"}
10168	§  Secondly, the authors should state the need for their work, by presenting it as an opposition between what the scientific community currently has and what it needs or wants.	{"37, 175, CONTENT","32, 37, ACTION","25, 31, MODAL"}
10169	§  Thirdly, the authors should indicate what they have done in their conducted study in order to address the existing  need, namely the task that they set out to solve.	{"24, 30, MODAL","105, 167, CONTENT","97, 104, ACTION","31, 39, ACTION","39, 84, CONTENT"}
10170	§  Finally, the authors should preview the remainder of the paper in order to prepare the readers for the subsequent structuring  of the manuscript.	{"78, 85, ACTION","30, 38, ACTION","24, 30, MODAL","137, 147, LOCATION","38, 65, CONTENT","98, 128, CONTENT"}
10171	§  In a scientific article, an important role of the“Introduction” section is to offer authors the opportunity to analyze in detail the current state of knowledge related to the manuscript’s topic, namely the most relevant scientific works in the field in order to be able to contextualize their study and familiarize the readers with what has been done in the literature and what advancement their study aims to bring in addition to the existing body of knowledge. I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover several (like the authors have did) scientific works in a short sentence just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section.	{"662, 681, LOCATION","508, 522, LOCATION","523, 604, CONTENT","481, 503, ACTION","52, 74, LOCATION"}
10172	§  I consider that the authors should perform the literature review in a manner that emphasizes for each scientific work that was cited in the text of the manuscript the contribution that was made to the existing state of art, the approach that was employed along with a short description of the most important results that have been obtained along with the existing unsolved issues of the referenced studies. By doing so, the authors will be able to better place their study in a broad body of knowledge and highlight unsolved  problems that still exist regarding the subject that their manuscript addresses.	{"166, 408, CONTENT","143, 147, LOCATION","435, 439, MODAL","463, 504, CONTENT","509, 518, ACTION","519, 576, CONTENT","31, 37, MODAL","46, 135, CONTENT","38, 45, ACTION","458, 463, ACTION","155, 165, LOCATION","588, 598, LOCATION"}
10173	§  The authors have cited some valuable works from the current state of art, works that are relevant to their study, but the literature review conducted within the Introduction section should be extended  as to cover a higher number of important scientific works from the literature and must be performed in a critical manner like I have explained  in the above comments.	{"164, 184, LOCATION","295, 304, ACTION","287, 291, MODAL","121, 152, CONTENT","208, 282, CONTENT","195, 203, ACTION","304, 325, CONTENT","117, 120, TRIGGER","185, 191, MODAL"}
10175	§  Just like in the case of the abstract, it will benefit to state the novel aspects of the conducted study, only this time to position the statements before the final paragraph of the Introduction section in which the authors detail how their paper is structured subsequently.	{"32, 40, LOCATION","45, 49, MODAL","136, 150, CONTENT","61, 66, ACTION","127, 135, ACTION","151, 206, LOCATION","67, 107, CONTENT"}
10176	§  In addition to this, the authors should modify the citations in accordance with the MDPI Symmetry Journal's Template.	{"36, 42, MODAL","49, 120, CONTENT","43, 49, ACTION"}
10178	§   In order to help the readers better understand the methodology of the conducted research, the authors should devise a flowchart within the "Materials and Methods" section, a flowchart that depicts the steps that the authors have processed in developing their research and most important of all, the final target. This flowchart will facilitate the understanding of the proposed approach and in the same time will make the article more interesting  and help promote it to the readers if used as a graphical abstract.	{"120, 131, CONTENT","112, 119, ACTION","461, 518, CONTENT","317, 331, CONTENT","106, 112, MODAL","456, 460, ACTION","201, 315, CONTENT","143, 174, LOCATION","176, 188, CONTENT","422, 450, CONTENT","417, 421, ACTION","412, 416, MODAL","347, 390, CONTENT","336, 347, ACTION","332, 336, MODAL","193, 200, ACTION"}
10179	§   The equations should be explained , demonstrated or cited, as there are some equations that have not been introduced in the literature for the first time by the authors and that are not cited with rapport to the initial source, to the authors that have introduced them in the literature. The authors should provide a more detailed explanation of how they came up with these equations by citing  the appropriate sources from the literature. Please revise the mathematical formalism of the equations.	{"451, 457, ACTION","18, 24, MODAL","304, 311, MODAL","56, 62, ACTION","121, 158, CONTENT","40, 53, ACTION","458, 501, CONTENT","182, 195, ACTION","319, 442, CONTENT","76, 90, CONTENT","311, 318, ACTION","96, 120, ACTION","27, 37, ACTION","4, 17, CONTENT"}
10180	§   It will benefit the paper to specify details regarding  the version numbers for the software and the detailed hardware configuration used within the research in order to assure the reproducibility of the study.	{"7, 11, MODAL","41, 213, CONTENT","33, 40, ACTION"}
10181	Ø  Comments regarding the "Discussion" section:	{"26, 46, LOCATION"}
10182	§   A section of paramount importance, the“Discussion” one, does not exist in the manuscript under review. I consider that this section must be mandatory elaborated in order for the authors to prove a contribution that their research has brought to the current state of knowledge. It is the“Discussion” section that offers the possibility to validate the contribution and usefulness of the conducted study from the manuscript by comparing the research design, the proposed approach, the registered experimental results with the ones obtained by other valuable scientific works.	{"123, 135, LOCATION","42, 54, LOCATION","136, 140, MODAL","190, 279, CONTENT","290, 310, LOCATION","154, 164, ACTION","81, 92, LOCATION","60, 74, ACTION"}
10183	§   In the“Discussion” section it will benefit to examine, to debate the registered results and the way how they can be regarded with prospects to preceding researches that have targeted  similar goals. Unfortunately, in the current form of the manuscript under review this discussion, this debate does not exist. The authors must address these important aspects in order to be able to pin point exactly the clear advancement that their conducted study from manuscript has made to the current body of knowledge.	{"34, 38, MODAL","383, 395, ACTION","339, 362, CONTENT","331, 338, ACTION","326, 330, MODAL","62, 68, ACTION","50, 57, ACTION","69, 201, CONTENT","245, 255, LOCATION","286, 297, CONTENT","298, 312, ACTION","395, 511, CONTENT","10, 22, LOCATION"}
10184	§   It is in the“Discussion” section where the authors should underline both the advantages and disadvantages of their proposed approach when compared with other valuable studies from the current state of art.	{"72, 208, CONTENT","37, 42, TRIGGER","61, 71, ACTION","55, 61, MODAL","16, 28, LOCATION"}
10185	§   It will increase the value of the article if the authors mention in this section if they have tried other approaches before reaching the current developed method from the manuscript and what did the results reveal that determined them to devise the current form of their method.	{"84, 165, CONTENT","72, 84, LOCATION","7, 11, MODAL","175, 186, LOCATION","190, 194, TRIGGER","61, 68, ACTION","195, 281, CONTENT","21, 45, CONTENT","11, 20, ACTION"}
10186	§   The scientific value of the Discussion section and of the manuscript under review implicitly will be considerably increased if the authors provide an insight regarding the feasibility of implementing their proposed  approach, highlighting if the research can be reproduced and implemented  in a real case everyday use scenario by providing the very important implementation details, namely the applicability of the study.	{"32, 50, LOCATION","151, 424, CONTENT","97, 101, MODAL","143, 150, ACTION","62, 72, LOCATION"}
10187	§   I consider that the manuscript will be considerably improved  if the authors state clearly within the manuscript who are the potential beneficiaries (even if they can be deduced  from the study) of the devised approach (proving once again the usefulness of the conducted study) and how will these potential beneficiaries be able to make use of the devised approach in their everyday activities. Are there any special constraints (material, ethical, financial or any other types) that have to be taken into account when employing the devised approach in a real case everyday use scenario?	{"35, 39, MODAL","81, 87, ACTION","56, 64, ACTION","117, 282, CONTENT","286, 289, TRIGGER","24, 34, LOCATION","106, 116, LOCATION","290, 397, CONTENT","399, 590, CONTENT"}
10188	§   The manuscript will be considerable improved if the authors offer their insight within the Discussion session towards the estimated benefits that will be obtained after putting  into practice their proposed approach in rapport with all the associated  implementation costs. Is the proposed approach feasible from the economic point of view?	{"39, 49, ACTION","8, 18, LOCATION","95, 113, LOCATION","114, 276, CONTENT","278, 343, CONTENT","69, 84, CONTENT","64, 69, ACTION","19, 23, MODAL"}
10190	§   Regarding the final statements of the“Discussion” section, it will increase the manuscript’s value if the authors make, based on the overall elaborated discussions, a clear argumentative statement regarding the procedures, the facts or processes that one must follow in order to achieve, to attain an outcome from the proposed approach with maximum efficiency.	{"70, 79, ACTION","41, 61, LOCATION","118, 122, ACTION","169, 364, CONTENT","66, 70, MODAL","80, 102, CONTENT"}
10191	§   If the above-mentioned aspects from the review report are implemented by the authors this means the paper will have included a very well-structured Introduction and a correctly structured abstract, therefore the authors should not repeat any part from the Introduction in the Conclusion section. The authors should not restate (like they did in the current form of the manuscript) what they have done or what the article does, they should focus instead on what they have discovered and most important on what their findings mean.	{"312, 322, MODAL","280, 298, LOCATION","260, 272, LOCATION","242, 250, CONTENT","373, 383, LOCATION","235, 241, ACTION","457, 533, CONTENT","323, 330, ACTION","224, 234, MODAL","104, 109, LOCATION","110, 114, MODAL","436, 442, MODAL","385, 431, CONTENT","191, 200, LOCATION","152, 164, LOCATION","442, 448, ACTION"}
10192	§   At the end of the Conclusion, if they feel necessary, the authors can challenge the reader e.g. “One remaining aspect to reflect upon consists in …”	{"4, 32, LOCATION","100, 152, CONTENT","74, 83, ACTION","70, 73, MODAL"}
10193	§   The authors should write a short Conclusion section, in fact they should conclude in just a few sentences given the rich discussion section they will have developed in the body of the paper. I strongly recommend the authors to overcome the temptation to repeat material from the Introduction or from the rest of the paper only to make the Conclusion longer under the false belief that a longer Conclusion section will seem more impressive.	{"86, 109, CONTENT","231, 239, ACTION","239, 361, CONTENT","16, 22, MODAL","23, 28, ACTION","31, 55, CONTENT","70, 76, MODAL","76, 85, ACTION"}
10194	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: symmetry-708297, with the title "Analysis and Prediction of Chaotic Time Series Based on Deep Learning Neural Networks". In this paper, the authors propose an extension of recurrent neural networks, namely a Differencing Long Short-Term Memory (D-LSTM) architecture, with the purpose of reducing the noise of the original data to make it smooth and improve the prediction accuracy of Chaotic Time Series.	{"67, 154, LOCATION","20, 30, LOCATION"}
10195	I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors address within the manuscript the following  aspects:	{"73, 83, LOCATION","39, 41, TRIGGER","26, 30, MODAL","83, 106, CONTENT","53, 61, ACTION"}
10196	Overall comments regarding the manuscript.	{"31, 41, LOCATION"}
10198	Specific comments regarding the manuscript.	{"32, 42, LOCATION"}
10199	Remark regarding the proposed 3D nonlinear chaotic system. Can the authors mention how much of their model is being  influenced by their proposed 3D nonlinear chaotic system or to which extent the model can be easily applied  to other situations, when the chaotic system is different? In this way, the authors could highlight more the generalization capability of their approach in order to be able to justify a wider contribution that has been brought to the current state of art.	{"310, 315, MODAL","82, 285, CONTENT","58, 62, MODAL","315, 326, ACTION","326, 481, CONTENT","75, 82, ACTION"}
10200	Remark regarding the line numbers. The line numbers are missing in the whole pdf manuscript submitted by the authors, so I had to refer to excerpts of text and page numbers in order to pin-point my comments.	{"81, 91, LOCATION","56, 63, ACTION","35, 51, CONTENT"}
10201	Remarks regarding the sections of the manuscript. The sections of the manuscript in its actual form are not according to the ones recommended by the Symmetry MDPI Journal's Template. The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the above-mentioned template that provides a more logical structure that is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to better express the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review should be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5. Conclusions (not mandatory), 6. Patents (not mandatory), Supplementary Materials (not mandatory), Author Contributions, Funding, Acknowledgments, Conflicts of Interest, Appendices and References.	{"100, 107, ACTION","232, 245, ACTION","108, 181, CONTENT","612, 618, MODAL","187, 197, LOCATION","246, 385, CONTENT","387, 404, CONTENT","412, 422, LOCATION","622, 634, ACTION","449, 569, CONTENT","211, 215, MODAL","648, 936, CONTENT","433, 437, ACTION","423, 427, MODAL","22, 30, LOCATION","38, 48, LOCATION","54, 62, LOCATION","69, 79, LOCATION"}
10202	Remark regarding the Abstract of the paper. In the "Abstract" of the paper, the authors must present in a clearer manner the following  aspects: the background, the methods, the main findings, the conclusions, as in the actual form of the manuscript, the abstract offers information related only to some of these aspects and even so, their delimitation is unclear. In the "Abstract" of the paper, along with the above-mentioned elements, the authors should briefly state the novelty of their proposed approach. In the actual form of the manuscript, the abstract offers information related only to some of these aspects and even so, their delimitation is unclear.	{"121, 365, CONTENT","537, 547, LOCATION","553, 561, LOCATION","92, 100, ACTION","465, 470, ACTION","450, 456, MODAL","21, 29, LOCATION","88, 92, MODAL","372, 382, LOCATION","471, 509, CONTENT","51, 61, LOCATION"}
10203	Remarks regarding the "Introduction" section. "Using time-series information is theoretically a neural network that expands over time [16]-[22]. Unfortunately, when the time distance increases, RNN will become unable to connect related information, so the LSTM network (Long Short -Term Memory networks) is proposed, which is a special form of RNN, and is characterized by being able to learn long-distance dependencies. Used in other different fields [23]-[25], first proposed by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997) [26], this experimental data is a chaotic time series, which is closely related to time in prediction. LSTM has been widely applied in many field, especially in time series modeling, including speech recognition, natural language processing and sequence prediction [27]-[28]." I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 13 (like the authors did) or even more scientific works in a few lines just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section. In this section, the authors must introduce a presentation of the current state of the research field by reviewing it carefully and by citing key publications. By doing so, the problem will be put into context and it will benefit the readers as well. The purpose of the literature survey is to highlight for each of the involved referenced papers the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the method used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article. This is the only way to contextualize the current state of the art in which the authors of the manuscript position their paper and address aspects that have not been tackled/solved yet by the existing studies.	{"1758, 1827, CONTENT","22, 44, LOCATION","46, 789, LOCATION","1178, 1189, CONTENT","809, 827, ACTION","836, 846, LOCATION","1034, 1038, MODAL","1039, 1048, ACTION","1190, 1194, MODAL","1202, 1214, CONTENT","1221, 1227, MODAL","1227, 1234, ACTION","1235, 1246, CONTENT","1750, 1757, ACTION","847, 926, CONTENT","985, 1003, LOCATION","1008, 1020, LOCATION","1049, 1163, CONTENT","1198, 1201, ACTION","1714, 1724, LOCATION","1643, 1656, ACTION","1657, 1685, CONTENT"}
10204	In this section, the authors state: "Differencing is especially in the time series, it eliminates the influence of time on the two time points and let chaotic time series adhering stationarity. The benefits of which are include above method that not only improve the convergence speed and accuracy of the iterative solution, but also do not change the distribution of the original data." I do not contradict this information, but a citation is needed for this statement. Moreover, due to the use of the English language, the paragraph is not completely clear.	{"3, 15, LOCATION","471, 479, TRIGGER","521, 534, CONTENT","488, 519, CONTENT","430, 440, CONTENT","36, 387, LOCATION","426, 429, TRIGGER","535, 558, ACTION","444, 450, ACTION"}
10205	After having performed a critical survey of what has been done up to this point in the scientific literature, the authors must identify a gap in the current state of knowledge that needs to be filled, a gap that is being addressed by their manuscript. This gap must also be used afterwards, in the "Discussion" section of the manuscript (that currently does not exist) as well, where the authors should justify why their approach fills the identified gap in rapport with previous studies from the literature. In the "Introduction" section the authors must also declare the novel aspects of their work.	{"261, 265, MODAL","274, 278, ACTION","127, 135, ACTION","279, 289, CONTENT","551, 555, MODAL","561, 568, ACTION","402, 410, ACTION","298, 318, LOCATION","396, 402, MODAL","411, 508, CONTENT","240, 250, LOCATION","252, 260, CONTENT","515, 531, LOCATION","122, 126, MODAL","569, 601, CONTENT","326, 336, LOCATION","136, 199, CONTENT"}
10206	Remarks regarding the "Materials and Methods" section. It will benefit the paper if the authors restructure their paper and devise a proper "Materials and methods" section (which is currently missing from the manuscript), in which the new developed methods are described in detail while well-established methods (and information) are briefly described and appropriately cited. In order to bring a benefit to the manuscript, the authors should state and justify very clear in the "Materials and Methods" section, preferably within the first paragraph, the choices they have made when developing the final form of their proposed approach. The authors should state what has justified using  this approach, what is special, unexpected, or different in their research methodology. It will benefit the paper if the authors mention if they have tried other approaches that in the end led them to the current form of their research design.	{"412, 422, LOCATION","534, 549, LOCATION","825, 930, CONTENT","131, 171, CONTENT","192, 199, ACTION","209, 219, LOCATION","230, 256, CONTENT","286, 329, CONTENT","551, 635, CONTENT","95, 107, ACTION","107, 120, CONTENT","124, 130, ACTION","342, 351, ACTION","370, 375, ACTION","436, 442, MODAL","443, 448, ACTION","453, 460, ACTION","479, 510, LOCATION","649, 655, MODAL","656, 661, ACTION","817, 824, ACTION","261, 270, ACTION","662, 774, CONTENT","779, 783, MODAL","58, 62, MODAL","22, 53, LOCATION"}
10207	In order to help the readers better understand the methodology of the conducted study, in the "Materials and Methods" section the authors should devise a flowchart that depicts the steps that they have processed in developing  their research and most important of all, the final target. This flowchart will facilitate the understanding  of the proposed approach.	{"318, 362, CONTENT","138, 144, MODAL","145, 152, ACTION","154, 285, CONTENT","302, 307, MODAL","307, 318, ACTION","94, 125, LOCATION"}
10208	Remark regarding the equations within the manuscript. The equations within the manuscript should be explained , demonstrated or cited, for example equation (32) is not cited.	{"112, 125, ACTION","128, 133, ACTION","90, 96, MODAL","99, 109, ACTION","42, 52, LOCATION","54, 67, CONTENT","79, 89, LOCATION","161, 173, ACTION","147, 160, LOCATION"}
10209	Remarks regarding the "Discussion" section. In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Discussion" section (which is currently missing from the manuscript), the authors should make a comparison between their approach from the manuscript and other similar ones that have been developed and used in the literature for the same or related purposes. There are a lot of valuable studies in the scientific literature related to the subject of the manuscript to which the authors can compare to and this comparison will highlight even more the novel aspects that their paper has brought in contrast to the existing   studies.	{"461, 471, LOCATION","56, 65, ACTION","195, 200, ACTION","201, 364, CONTENT","65, 175, CONTENT","493, 496, MODAL","497, 504, ACTION","512, 637, CONTENT","189, 195, MODAL","22, 42, LOCATION"}
10210	The authors should present the findings and their main implications in the "Discussion" section, also highlighting current limitations of their study, and briefly mention some precise directions that they intend to follow in their future research work.	{"12, 19, MODAL","75, 95, LOCATION","163, 171, ACTION","175, 251, CONTENT","19, 26, ACTION","102, 149, CONTENT","27, 67, CONTENT"}
10211	I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their analysis and provide an insight at the end of the "Discussion" section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained results, the most important, appropriate and concrete actions that the decisional factors and all the involved parties should take in order to benefit from the results of the research conducted within the manuscript.	{"159, 306, CONTENT","311, 335, CONTENT","422, 432, LOCATION","342, 356, ACTION","127, 158, LOCATION","109, 120, CONTENT","100, 108, ACTION","54, 58, ACTION","61, 96, CONTENT","26, 30, MODAL","360, 410, CONTENT","336, 342, MODAL"}
10212	Remarks regarding the citations. One of the most important aspects that must be mentioned is the fact that the authors have documented  their research but there are some issues regarding the citations. In some cases, even if the papers from the scientific literature are cited, the authors have not written the information with their own words in the manuscript under review. Therefore, in the actual form of the manuscript, many paragraphs from the paper under review are identical to ones from the scientific literature, and in the following are mentioned a few examples:	{"307, 343, CONTENT","151, 154, TRIGGER","72, 76, MODAL","351, 361, LOCATION","425, 521, CONTENT","376, 385, TRIGGER","290, 306, ACTION","155, 200, CONTENT","93, 150, CONTENT","44, 66, CONTENT","80, 89, ACTION","412, 423, LOCATION"}
10213	In section II, subsection D, at the last lines of page 2, the authors state: "The equations for spectral entropy arise from the equations for the power spectrum and probability distribution for a signal." This sentence could be found in an identical form on the website https://ww2.mathworks.cn/help/signal/ref/pentropy.html (accessed on 18 January 2020).	{"228, 233, ACTION","3, 13, LOCATION","15, 27, LOCATION","36, 56, LOCATION","240, 354, CONTENT","205, 218, CONTENT","77, 205, LOCATION","219, 224, MODAL"}
10214	In section III, before presenting equation (20), the authors state: "Sometimes it may be necessary to difference the data a second time to obtain a stationary time series, which is referred to as second order differencing:…" This sentence could be found in an identical form on the website https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average (accessed on 18 January 2020).	{"225, 238, CONTENT","239, 244, MODAL","260, 391, CONTENT","68, 225, LOCATION","3, 14, LOCATION","16, 47, LOCATION","248, 253, ACTION"}
10215	In section IV, before equation (28), the authors state: "A moving mean is commonly used with time series data to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends or cycles. The threshold between short­-term and long-term depends on the application, and the parameters of the moving mean will be set accordingly." This sentence could be found in an almost identical form (A moving average is commonly used with data to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends or cycles. The threshold between short-term and long-term depends on the application, and the parameters of the moving average will be set accordingly.) on the website https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average (accessed on 18 January 2020).	{"355, 360, ACTION","332, 345, CONTENT","346, 352, MODAL","3, 13, LOCATION","15, 35, LOCATION","367, 748, CONTENT","56, 332, LOCATION"}
10216	The authors must address these issues (the ones from the mentioned examples and many others from the paper) by properly citing the references and by writing the information with their own words in the manuscript (or they must use quotation marks). However, taking into account that the used information does not represent famous quotes, statements of elderly scholars, I find it more suitable for the authors to express the concerned ideas with their own words and refer them accordingly.	{"17, 24, ACTION","412, 420, ACTION","12, 16, MODAL","248, 255, TRIGGER","465, 471, ACTION","471, 488, CONTENT","424, 460, CONTENT","230, 245, CONTENT","226, 229, ACTION","221, 225, MODAL","201, 211, LOCATION","25, 193, CONTENT"}
10217	Remarks regarding the format of the paper. In addition to the above-mentioned issues, the authors must perform a thorough editing  of their manuscript in order to achieve a proper readable paper. The authors must take into account the recommendations from the MDPI Symmetry Journal website regarding  the format of the papers ( https://www.mdpi.com/journal/symmetry/instructions ), by using the Microsoft Word template or LaTeX template to prepare their manuscript. In the actual form of the paper, most of these recommendations have not been taken into account. Therefore, the reading of the manuscript is affected. Please correct this aspect according to the Journal's Template.	{"499, 528, CONTENT","529, 561, ACTION","140, 150, LOCATION","632, 679, CONTENT","624, 632, ACTION","563, 572, TRIGGER","454, 464, LOCATION","440, 448, ACTION","395, 436, CONTENT","235, 380, CONTENT","213, 230, ACTION","208, 213, MODAL","113, 129, CONTENT","103, 111, ACTION","98, 103, MODAL"}
10218	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: resources-476526, with the title "MARPOL issues in Canary Islands’ ports: alternatives and optimization of energy management". In this paper, the authors focus their research on searching for alternatives to improve the current issue of waste management and energy sustainability in isolated systems. The authors state that through their approach, from an environmental and energy saving point of view, pollutant emissions and waste stream are reduced significantly. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors address within the manuscript the following  aspects:	{"20, 30, LOCATION","590, 608, CONTENT","556, 564, ACTION","68, 160, LOCATION","528, 532, MODAL","575, 585, LOCATION"}
10219	Ø General remarks about the paper. The Manuscript ID: resources-476526 is interesting, but it still remains an aspect that must be clarified  by the authors, namely the fact that they must assume more clearly their own results. I consider that the authors must assume more clearly in the paper their original contribution by specifying this fact and by highlighting the fact that starting from a certain point there are presented the original and novel aspects of their research. The authors must state more clearly their original methods, their original results and conclusions, the novelty of their study. In the current form of the paper, this aspect is unclear.	{"288, 293, LOCATION","261, 267, ACTION","294, 478, CONTENT","497, 502, ACTION","189, 195, ACTION","87, 90, TRIGGER","208, 226, CONTENT","184, 189, MODAL","130, 140, ACTION","123, 127, MODAL","39, 49, LOCATION","522, 606, CONTENT","492, 497, MODAL","256, 261, MODAL"}
10220	Ø The title of the manuscript. In the actual form of the paper, its title is "MARPOL issues in Canary Islands’ ports: alternatives and optimization of energy management". Acronyms and/or abbreviations should be avoided  in the title, even if they are widely known. Therefore, I consider that the authors should refer to "MARPOL" as "The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships", modifying the title accordingly.	{"332, 405, CONTENT","320, 328, LOCATION","311, 317, ACTION","304, 311, MODAL","265, 274, TRIGGER","171, 200, CONTENT","6, 11, LOCATION","210, 218, ACTION","201, 207, MODAL","77, 169, LOCATION","19, 29, LOCATION","227, 232, LOCATION","421, 426, LOCATION"}
10221	Ø Lines 9-26, the Abstract of the paper. It will benefit the paper if in the abstract, the authors specify also the main conclusions and afterwards, in addition to the already presented elements, the authors declare and briefly justify the novelty of their work.	{"44, 48, MODAL","208, 216, ACTION","228, 235, ACTION","240, 261, CONTENT","77, 85, LOCATION","18, 26, LOCATION","137, 147, TRIGGER","112, 132, CONTENT","99, 106, ACTION","2, 12, LOCATION"}
10222	Ø The sections of the manuscript in its actual form are not according to the ones recommended by the Resources MDPI Journal's Template. The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the above-mentioned template that provides a more logical structure that is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to better express the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review should be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5. Conclusions (not mandatory), 6. Patents (not mandatory), Supplementary Materials (not mandatory), Author Contributions, Funding, Acknowledgments, Conflicts of Interest, Appendices and References.	{"164, 168, MODAL","186, 199, ACTION","376, 381, MODAL","386, 391, ACTION","565, 572, MODAL","575, 589, ACTION","403, 523, CONTENT","22, 32, LOCATION","600, 888, CONTENT","139, 150, LOCATION","60, 134, CONTENT","52, 59, ACTION","199, 338, CONTENT","6, 14, LOCATION","340, 375, CONTENT"}
10223	Ø Lines 70-76, the "Motivation and state of art" section. "In the literature there is a wide variety of studies in which simple, complex models and systems dynamics, energy aspects are studied [12,13], issues related to renewable resource balance models. to investigate the exhaustion of those resources according to certain parameters [14]. But nevertheless, there is a lack of research works assessing the environmental impact costs of pollutants generated by routine shipping operations [15-21]. But, if attention is given only to what happens in ports, it is easy to see that there are far fewer studies evaluating attractive alternatives and efficient energy management systems. [22]." Firstly, I consider that this section's purpose and the one of the "Introduction" are overlapping and therefore I consider that the two sections should be concatenated and reorganized . Secondly, I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 11 (like the authors have did) or even more scientific works in a few lines just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the "References" section. In the "Introduction" section, the authors must introduce a presentation of the current state of the research field by reviewing it carefully and by citing other key publications. By doing so, the problem will be put into context and it will benefit the readers as well. The purpose of the literature survey is to highlight for each of the involved referenced papers the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the methods used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article. This is the only way to contextualize the current state of the art in which the authors of the manuscript position their paper and address aspects that have not been tackled/solved yet by the existing studies.	{"1782, 1870, CONTENT","1875, 1882, ACTION","1882, 1952, CONTENT","932, 943, LOCATION","906, 924, ACTION","943, 1028, CONTENT","1087, 1107, LOCATION","1167, 1287, CONTENT","1768, 1781, ACTION","2, 13, LOCATION","58, 690, LOCATION","793, 803, TRIGGER","846, 858, ACTION","863, 874, ACTION","819, 835, CONTENT","1322, 1338, ACTION","1314, 1319, MODAL","1152, 1157, MODAL","1116, 1138, LOCATION","836, 842, MODAL","19, 58, LOCATION","1157, 1167, ACTION"}
10224	Ø Lines 72-76, the "Introduction" section. In the "Introduction" section, the authors must specify clearly the gap in the current state of knowledge that they intend to fill with their proposed approach. The same gap must also be tackled afterwards, in the "Discussion" section of the manuscript (which is currently missing from the manuscript) as well, where the authors should justify why their approach fills the identified gap in rapport with previous studies from the literature.	{"230, 237, ACTION","86, 90, MODAL","2, 13, LOCATION","257, 277, LOCATION","372, 379, MODAL","379, 387, ACTION","387, 484, CONTENT","217, 222, MODAL","50, 72, LOCATION","19, 41, LOCATION","91, 98, ACTION","107, 202, CONTENT","204, 216, CONTENT","285, 295, LOCATION","316, 323, ACTION","333, 343, LOCATION"}
10225	Ø The "Materials and Methods" section. In order to help the readers better understand the methodology of the conducted study, in the "Materials and Methods" section (which is currently missing from the manuscript) the authors should devise a flowchart that depicts the steps that they have processed in developing  their research and most important of all, the final target. This flowchart will facilitate the understanding  of the proposed approach.	{"406, 449, CONTENT","185, 192, ACTION","202, 212, LOCATION","240, 373, CONTENT","133, 164, LOCATION","375, 389, CONTENT","395, 405, ACTION","233, 240, ACTION","5, 37, LOCATION","226, 233, MODAL","390, 395, MODAL"}
10226	Ø The "Results and Discussion" section. In this section, the authors have presented their results and among them, a series of forecasted results for the period 2015-2020. At Lines 291-292, the authors state: "The following results are based on tests and calculation models that took into account machinery performance, data taken from the sources, and characterizations already mentioned." I consider that the authors must provide more details regarding  their approach, the forecasting method that they have used in order to estimate, to predict these values.	{"423, 431, ACTION","418, 423, MODAL","6, 38, LOCATION","208, 389, LOCATION","436, 560, CONTENT","173, 187, LOCATION","43, 55, LOCATION"}
10227	Ø The "Results and Discussion" section. In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Results and Discussion" section, the authors should make a comparison between their approach from the manuscript and other similar ones that have been developed in the literature for the same or related purposes. In the actual form of the manuscript, the "Results and Discussion" section contains only one reference to other studies (and even this reference is not being used for comparing the results), so the comparison is missing in the manuscript's current form. There are a lot of valuable studies in the scientific literature related to the subject of the manuscript to which the authors can compare to and this comparison will highlight even more the novel aspects that their paper has brought in contrast to existing   studies. This comparison is mandatory in order to highlight the clear contribution to the current state of knowledge that the authors brought. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their analysis and provide an insight at the end of the "Results and Discussion" section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained results, the most important, appropriate and concrete actions that the decisional factors and all the involved parties should take in order to benefit from the results of the research conducted within the manuscript.	{"102, 134, LOCATION","665, 675, LOCATION","697, 700, MODAL","701, 708, ACTION","757, 837, CONTENT","839, 854, CONTENT","855, 867, ACTION","868, 971, CONTENT","992, 998, LOCATION","999, 1003, MODAL","1093, 1143, LOCATION","1144, 1291, CONTENT","1296, 1320, CONTENT","1333, 1395, CONTENT","1407, 1417, LOCATION","716, 731, CONTENT","6, 38, LOCATION","155, 160, ACTION","162, 314, CONTENT","358, 390, LOCATION","514, 524, CONTENT","528, 535, ACTION","582, 605, CONTENT","732, 737, MODAL","737, 746, ACTION","1321, 1327, MODAL","1328, 1332, ACTION","1026, 1031, ACTION","1031, 1069, CONTENT","1074, 1081, ACTION","1082, 1092, CONTENT","148, 154, MODAL"}
10228	Ø The "Results and Discussion" section, Figure 7. In this Figure, the authors have chosen to represent two different sets of data on the same graph, sharing the horizontal axis. Thus, they have chosen a first, left vertical axis representing the waste and a second, right vertical axis representing the energy contribution for self-consumption. For consistency reasons, in a scientific article one should not represent on the same chart different sets of physical entities. Consequently, the authors should present the two different charts for the two different sets of entities and adjust the vertical axis accordingly.	{"5, 38, LOCATION","40, 48, LOCATION","419, 472, CONTENT","500, 507, MODAL","594, 619, CONTENT","583, 590, ACTION","507, 515, ACTION","409, 418, ACTION","53, 64, LOCATION","398, 408, MODAL","515, 578, CONTENT"}
10229	Ø Remarks regarding the style. Lines 97-98: "…most visibly in birds’ feathers, fish gills, sea-bottom communities, etc."; Line 139: "…with rags, glass, ceramics, etc."; Line 141: "…fireworks/flares, etc."; Lines 286-287: "…its performance, the available flows, etc.". In a scientific paper one should avoid using  run-on expressions, such as "and so forth", "and so on" or "etc.". Therefore, instead of "etc.", the sentence should mention all the elements that are relevant to the analysis and to the obtained results in order to obtain a consistent, relevant and reproductible study.	{"301, 306, ACTION","342, 356, LOCATION","306, 332, CONTENT","357, 369, LOCATION","373, 379, LOCATION","392, 403, TRIGGER","403, 409, LOCATION","411, 424, CONTENT","439, 583, CONTENT","221, 266, LOCATION","168, 177, LOCATION","294, 301, MODAL","178, 204, LOCATION","44, 120, LOCATION","122, 130, LOCATION","131, 167, LOCATION","424, 431, MODAL","431, 439, ACTION","206, 219, LOCATION","381, 390, TRIGGER","31, 42, LOCATION"}
10230	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: energies-381041, with the title "An Efficient Active and Reactive Power Control of DFIG for wind power generator".  In this paper, the authors present a comparative study on the performance of different control strategies for doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbines. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors address within the manuscript the following  aspects:	{"402, 420, CONTENT","368, 376, ACTION","340, 345, MODAL","67, 148, LOCATION","20, 30, LOCATION","387, 397, LOCATION"}
10231	The sections of the manuscript in its actual form are not according to the ones recommended by the Energies MDPI Journal's Template. The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the above-mentioned template that provides a more logical structure, which is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to better express the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review must be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5. Conclusions (not mandatory), 6. Patents (not mandatory), Supplementary Materials (not mandatory), Author Contributions, Funding, Acknowledgments, Conflicts of Interest, Appendices and References.	{"137, 147, LOCATION","20, 30, LOCATION","50, 57, ACTION","540, 550, LOCATION","385, 389, ACTION","375, 379, MODAL","339, 356, CONTENT","196, 337, CONTENT","58, 131, CONTENT","598, 885, CONTENT","183, 195, ACTION","360, 374, LOCATION","405, 520, CONTENT","564, 569, MODAL","572, 586, ACTION","161, 165, MODAL"}
10232	In the "Abstract" of the paper, in addition to the elements already presented, the authors must state the novelty of their approach.	{"105, 131, CONTENT","96, 102, ACTION","91, 96, MODAL","7, 17, LOCATION"}
10233	In the "Introduction" section, the authors must pin point an exact deficiency, an unsolved problem that still exists in the current body of knowledge that their study addresses. It will benefit the paper if in the "Introduction" section the authors declare the novel aspects of their work.	{"7, 29, LOCATION","257, 288, CONTENT","61, 176, CONTENT","48, 58, ACTION","214, 236, LOCATION","249, 257, ACTION","43, 47, MODAL","204, 206, TRIGGER","181, 185, MODAL","198, 203, LOCATION"}
10234	In order to help the readers better understand the methodology of the conducted approach, in the "Materials and Methods" section (that for the time being is missing completely from the manuscript) the authors should devise a flowchart that depicts the steps that they have processed in developing  their research and most important of all, the final target. This flowchart will facilitate the understanding of the proposed approach and in the same time will make the article more interesting  to the readers if used as a graphical abstract.	{"185, 195, LOCATION","157, 164, ACTION","97, 128, LOCATION","463, 539, CONTENT","358, 372, CONTENT","223, 357, CONTENT","389, 431, CONTENT","209, 216, MODAL","216, 223, ACTION","378, 389, ACTION","453, 458, MODAL","458, 462, ACTION","373, 377, MODAL"}
10235	In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Discussion" section (that for the time being is missing completely from the manuscript), the authors should make a comparison between their study from the manuscript and other similar ones that have been designed and described in the literature. The authors should also highlight current limitations of their study, and briefly mention some precise directions that they intend to follow in their future research work.	{"391, 399, ACTION","178, 309, CONTENT","321, 328, MODAL","333, 343, ACTION","343, 362, CONTENT","404, 480, CONTENT","164, 170, MODAL","171, 176, ACTION","111, 118, ACTION","62, 82, LOCATION","139, 149, LOCATION"}
10236	At the line 249, the authors state: "The design weights W1(s) and W2(s) were selected as…". I consider that the authors must justify this choice and why do they exclude other options.	{"36, 91, LOCATION","7, 15, LOCATION","138, 182, CONTENT","125, 133, ACTION","120, 125, MODAL"}
10237	In addition to the above-mentioned issues, the authors should also address the following  aspects within the manuscript:	{"79, 98, CONTENT","109, 119, LOCATION","55, 62, MODAL","67, 75, ACTION"}
10238	·     The Title "An Efficient Active and Reactive Power Control of DFIG for wind power generator".  Acronyms must be avoided  in the title, even if they are widely known. Regarding the other acronyms used in the manuscript, they should be explained the first time when they are introduced .	{"253, 288, CONTENT","239, 248, ACTION","109, 113, MODAL","116, 124, ACTION","16, 97, LOCATION","10, 15, LOCATION","229, 236, MODAL","185, 199, CONTENT","100, 108, CONTENT","133, 138, LOCATION","212, 222, LOCATION"}
10239	·     The "References" section contains some papers, namely the references [26]-[29] and [32] that have not been cited in the manuscript at all. The authors must address this issue by citing in the paper only the references that have been used and by deleting  the ones that are not useful in the context of the manuscript.	{"99, 118, ACTION","157, 161, MODAL","162, 169, ACTION","184, 322, CONTENT","60, 94, CONTENT","126, 136, LOCATION","10, 30, LOCATION"}

10245	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: electronics-716913, representing the revised version of the Manuscript ID: electronics-568277, having the title "Driver’s Social Relationship Based Clustering and Transmission in Vehicle Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs)" and I can conclude that even if overall the manuscript has been improved, the authors did not address all the signaled issues and have actually procrastinated, postponed some aspects. Therefore, I have devised and wrote the following comments to the authors of the manuscript under review:	{"334, 349, ACTION","513, 523, LOCATION","350, 430, CONTENT","292, 303, LOCATION","147, 247, LOCATION","432, 441, TRIGGER","20, 30, LOCATION"}
10246	The "Discussion" section. The current form of the "Discussion" section is not appropriate as it contains only 19 lines and it does not mention a series of important elements required by this section. For example, in order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Discussion" section, the authors should make a comparison between their approach from the manuscript and other similar ones that have been developed in the literature for the same or related purposes. In the actual form of the manuscript, the "Discussion" section contains only one reference to other studies, so the comparison is insufficiently approached in the manuscript's current form. There are many other studies in the scientific literature related to the subject of the manuscript to which the authors can compare to and this comparison will highlight even more the novel aspects that their paper brought in contrast to the existing   studies. This comparison is mandatory in order to highlight the clear contribution to the current state of knowledge that the authors brought. The authors did not address this issue in the revised version of the manuscript even if I have signaled it in my previous review reports.	{"320, 475, CONTENT","787, 791, MODAL","791, 799, ACTION","667, 765, CONTENT","806, 821, CONTENT","822, 827, MODAL","827, 837, ACTION","309, 315, MODAL","851, 865, CONTENT","970, 980, ACTION","4, 24, LOCATION","50, 70, LOCATION","315, 320, ACTION","213, 266, CONTENT","1075, 1090, ACTION","928, 944, CONTENT","519, 539, LOCATION","275, 295, LOCATION","945, 957, ACTION","93, 198, CONTENT","1091, 1124, CONTENT","1132, 1142, LOCATION","71, 89, ACTION","980, 1061, CONTENT"}
10247	The "Discussion" section. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their analysis and provide an insight at the end of the "Discussion" section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained results, the most important, appropriate and concrete actions that the decisional factors and all the involved parties should take in order to benefit from the results of the research conducted within the manuscript. The authors did not address this issue in the revised version of the manuscript even if I have signaled it in my previous review reports.	{"337, 361, CONTENT","184, 332, CONTENT","85, 122, CONTENT","383, 436, CONTENT","448, 458, LOCATION","472, 487, ACTION","488, 521, CONTENT","529, 539, LOCATION","368, 382, ACTION","362, 368, MODAL","3, 24, LOCATION","149, 184, LOCATION","134, 145, CONTENT","52, 56, MODAL","127, 134, ACTION","80, 85, ACTION"}
10248	Lines 94-95: "…N (1,2,3,. . .N) is the number of vehicles within their region; G (1,2,3,. . .G) is the initial group number of the node…" The authors must explain in more details what is the meaning  of the two pairs of parentheses within these lines.	{"12, 137, LOCATION","155, 162, ACTION","0, 11, LOCATION","150, 154, MODAL","163, 250, CONTENT"}

10253	The manuscript under review is interesting, documented and generally well structured. However, I consider that the article will benefit if the authors take into account the following  remarks and address within the manuscript the signaled issues:	{"151, 168, ACTION","168, 191, CONTENT","123, 128, MODAL","215, 225, LOCATION","230, 245, CONTENT","196, 203, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION","86, 93, TRIGGER"}
10254	Overall comments regarding the manuscript. The manuscript under review approaches a very interesting topic for the experts in the field but it still remains an aspect that must be clarified  by the authors, namely the fact that they must assume more clearly their own results. I consider that the authors must assume more clearly in the paper their original contribution by specifying this fact and by highlighting the fact that starting  from a certain point there are presented the original and novel aspects of their paper. The authors must state more clearly their original methods, their original results and conclusions, the novelty of their study. In the current form of the paper, this aspect is unclear.	{"172, 176, MODAL","179, 189, ACTION","136, 139, TRIGGER","31, 41, LOCATION","238, 245, ACTION","544, 549, ACTION","337, 342, LOCATION","349, 525, CONTENT","310, 316, ACTION","258, 275, CONTENT","47, 57, LOCATION","233, 238, MODAL","305, 310, MODAL","539, 544, MODAL","563, 653, CONTENT"}
10255	Specific comments regarding the manuscript.	{"32, 42, LOCATION"}
10256	Remark 1. Lines 15-48, the "Abstract" of the paper. In the "Abstract" of the paper, in addition to the elements already presented, the authors must state the novelty of their approach. Moreover, it will benefit the paper if the authors reformulate this section in a more concise way, as the actual form of the "Abstract" is too long.	{"10, 21, LOCATION","198, 202, MODAL","185, 193, TRIGGER","236, 248, ACTION","248, 260, LOCATION","260, 282, CONTENT","287, 332, CONTENT","154, 183, CONTENT","148, 153, ACTION","143, 148, MODAL","59, 69, LOCATION","27, 37, LOCATION"}
10257	Remark 2. Lines 52-174, the "Introduction" and the "Literature review" sections. Within these two sections, the authors must state more clearly a gap in the current state of knowledge that needs to be filled, a gap that is being addressed by their manuscript. In the current form of the paper, at Lines 107-108, the authors state: "Therefore, the present study can attempt to close this knowledge gap." I consider that the expression "can attempt to…" does not represent the best choice for a scientific approach, as it implies a degree of uncertainty. At the end of the "Introduction" section, the authors should present the structure of their paper, under the form: "The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 contains…".	{"434, 451, LOCATION","622, 737, CONTENT","88, 106, LOCATION","125, 130, ACTION","144, 238, CONTENT","248, 258, LOCATION","471, 512, CONTENT","451, 470, ACTION","614, 622, ACTION","607, 614, MODAL","571, 593, LOCATION","28, 42, LOCATION","51, 79, LOCATION","120, 124, MODAL","296, 310, LOCATION","331, 402, LOCATION","10, 22, LOCATION"}
10258	Remark 3. Lines 175-235, the "Data and method" section. In order to bring a benefit to the manuscript, the authors should state and justify very clear in the "Data and method" section, preferably within the first paragraph, the choices they have made when developing the final form of their proposed approach. The authors should state what has justified using  the given method, what is special, unexpected, or different in their approach in contrast to the existing body of knowledge. I consider that the manuscript under review will benefit if the authors make all of these aspects as clear as possible to the readers starting  from the first paragraph in order to give them a clear idea of what the entire approach is about. When presenting the devised approach in the "Data and method" section, it will be extremely helpful to design and insert a flowchart depicting the main sequence of steps that one has to process in order to reproduce the results of the conducted  study. This flowchart should be analyzed in detail within the manuscript by specifying all the elements needed  for each and every step, in order for one to be able to reproduce and reach the final results of the study.	{"10, 23, LOCATION","530, 534, MODAL","1006, 1014, ACTION","29, 54, LOCATION","115, 121, MODAL","122, 128, ACTION","132, 140, ACTION","158, 183, LOCATION","224, 308, CONTENT","322, 329, MODAL","329, 335, ACTION","335, 339, TRIGGER","340, 377, CONTENT","379, 384, TRIGGER","384, 484, CONTENT","558, 562, ACTION","563, 583, CONTENT","620, 628, ACTION","664, 726, CONTENT","744, 764, CONTENT","772, 797, LOCATION","802, 806, MODAL","831, 837, ACTION","842, 848, ACTION","849, 979, CONTENT","996, 1002, MODAL","91, 101, LOCATION","207, 222, LOCATION","639, 654, LOCATION","980, 995, CONTENT","1036, 1046, LOCATION","1047, 1192, CONTENT"}
10259	Remark 4. Lines 191-196, the "Data and method" section. "The present study is based on data collected between 2005 and 2018, all of which were obtained from the China Statistical Yearbook, China Environmental Statistics Yearbook, China Industrial Statistical Yearbook, statistical yearbooks of various provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government), the National Economic and Social Development Statistical Bulletin, Environmental Bulletins, and other relevant statistical materials and documents." The authors must provide more details regarding  the dimension of the dataset. How did the authors solve the problems related to missing data or abnormal values if they are to occur? I would like the authors to comment in the paper whether the conclusions obtained based on data collected during  the period 2005-2018 are still relevant today, in 2020, in what concerns the same indicators. The authors should provide explanations whether their study is consistent, whether the changes that may occur within the older dataset from the above-mentioned period and the current year risk altering the final result.	{"766, 771, LOCATION","619, 622, TRIGGER","772, 929, CONTENT","957, 1149, CONTENT","950, 957, ACTION","751, 758, ACTION","725, 730, MODAL","565, 617, CONTENT","557, 564, ACTION","552, 556, MODAL","56, 539, LOCATION","29, 54, LOCATION","623, 721, CONTENT","943, 949, MODAL","10, 23, LOCATION"}
10260	Remark 5. Lines 175-235, the "Data and method" section. It will benefit the paper to specify, in the "Data and method" section, details regarding the version numbers for the software and the detailed hardware configuration used within the research.	{"85, 92, ACTION","59, 63, MODAL","10, 23, LOCATION","128, 247, CONTENT","29, 54, LOCATION","101, 126, LOCATION"}
10261	Remark 6. Lines 197-235, the "Data and method" section, issues regarding the mathematical formalism. The authors must improve the mathematical formalism and pay more attention to the details. For example, the authors must explain what is the meaning of the variables denoted using  the letter s (in lowercase), in equations (3) and (4), as at lines 207-212 there are explained only the variables denoted using S (in uppercase).	{"126, 152, CONTENT","117, 125, ACTION","157, 175, ACTION","176, 190, CONTENT","217, 221, MODAL","222, 229, ACTION","314, 335, LOCATION","342, 356, LOCATION","356, 426, CONTENT","29, 54, LOCATION","238, 309, CONTENT","113, 117, MODAL","230, 234, TRIGGER","10, 23, LOCATION"}
10262	Remark 7. The tables and figures from the paper. In its actual form, the manuscript contains a lot of insufficiently interpreted and explained tables and figures, spreading along multiple pages (for example pages 9, 10 and half of page 11). The authors must explain and analyze in detail all the tables and figures that have been inserted within the manuscript, it is not suitable to put the reader in the situation of interpreting, analyzing, continuing or refining the study from the manuscript under review.	{"14, 32, LOCATION","253, 257, MODAL","257, 265, ACTION","307, 314, LOCATION","296, 301, LOCATION","350, 360, LOCATION","42, 47, LOCATION","73, 83, LOCATION","102, 142, ACTION","142, 149, LOCATION","154, 161, LOCATION","270, 277, ACTION","207, 238, LOCATION"}
10263	Remark 8. Line 247, Table 3. This table contains information regarding the integrated efficiency and decomposition efficiency of China’s industrial circular economy.  I do not contradict this information, but a proper citation is needed for it. In addition to this, as I have mentioned before, the authors must explain and analyze in detail the information presented within this table.	{"306, 310, MODAL","345, 366, CONTENT","374, 384, LOCATION","323, 330, ACTION","29, 39, LOCATION","20, 27, LOCATION","211, 226, CONTENT","230, 236, ACTION","311, 318, ACTION","205, 208, TRIGGER","10, 18, LOCATION"}
10265	Remark 10. Lines 385-412, the "Conclusions" section. In the "Conclusions" section the authors should avoid simply summarizing  the aspects that they have already stated in the body of the manuscript. Instead, they should interpret their findings at a higher level of abstraction than in the "Results and analysis" section. The authors should highlight whether, or to what extent they have managed to address the target proposed within the "Introduction" section. The authors should avoid restating everything  they did once again, but instead they should emphasize what their findings actually mean to the readers, therefore making the "Conclusions" section interesting and memorable to them.	{"475, 482, MODAL","482, 488, ACTION","548, 555, MODAL","488, 529, CONTENT","60, 81, LOCATION","101, 107, ACTION","114, 168, CONTENT","200, 207, TRIGGER","214, 220, MODAL","176, 198, LOCATION","531, 534, TRIGGER","342, 351, ACTION","570, 613, CONTENT","565, 570, TRIGGER","352, 359, TRIGGER","555, 565, ACTION","439, 461, LOCATION","371, 428, CONTENT","30, 51, LOCATION","657, 691, CONTENT","636, 657, LOCATION","625, 631, ACTION","221, 230, ACTION","236, 278, CONTENT","291, 321, LOCATION","615, 624, TRIGGER","335, 341, MODAL","94, 100, MODAL","367, 371, TRIGGER","11, 24, LOCATION"}
10266	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: resources-482767, with the title "Construction of a mathematical model of the volution of the Russian Arctic zone as a Dynamic self-Organizing System". In this paper, the authors develop algorithms and programs that allow to describe the evolution of the Arctic territories as a Dynamic self-Organizing System (DOS) located in the external environment. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors address within the manuscript the following  aspects:	{"20, 30, LOCATION","190, 200, LOCATION","461, 471, LOCATION","476, 494, CONTENT","414, 418, MODAL","442, 449, ACTION","427, 429, TRIGGER","68, 185, LOCATION"}
10267	Ø General remarks about the paper. The Manuscript ID: resources-482767 is interesting, but it still remains an aspect that must be emphasized and strengthened  more by the authors, namely the fact that they must assume more clearly the advancement to the current state of knowledge. I consider that the authors must assume more clearly in the paper their original contribution by specifying this fact and by highlighting the fact that starting from a certain point there are presented the original and novel aspects of their research. The authors must state more clearly their original methods, their original results and conclusions, the novelty of their study.	{"108, 117, CONTENT","131, 141, ACTION","146, 158, ACTION","343, 348, LOCATION","571, 662, CONTENT","552, 558, ACTION","547, 552, MODAL","425, 533, CONTENT","408, 420, ACTION","391, 400, CONTENT","380, 390, ACTION","355, 376, CONTENT","316, 323, ACTION","311, 316, MODAL","236, 281, CONTENT","212, 219, ACTION","207, 212, MODAL","123, 127, MODAL","87, 90, TRIGGER","39, 49, LOCATION"}
10268	Ø The title of the manuscript. In the actual form of the paper, its title is "Construction of a mathematical model of the volution of the Russian Arctic zone as a Dynamic self-Organizing System". According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the term volution means either "1: a rolling or revolving motion; 2. a spiral turn: twist, convolution; 3: a whorl of a spiral shell: volute". Please verify this title, are you sure that you wanted to write "volution"?	{"6, 11, LOCATION","391, 397, ACTION","77, 194, LOCATION","403, 408, LOCATION","448, 458, LOCATION"}
10269	Ø Lines 15-21, the Abstract of the paper. In the "Abstract" of the paper, the authors must present in a clearer manner the following  aspects: the background, the methods, the main findings, the conclusions, as in the actual form of the manuscript, the abstract offers information related only to some of these aspects and even so, their delimitation is unclear. In the "Abstract" of the paper, along with the above-mentioned elements, the authors should briefly state the novelty of their proposed approach.	{"91, 98, ACTION","19, 27, LOCATION","49, 59, LOCATION","448, 455, MODAL","473, 507, CONTENT","143, 318, CONTENT","370, 380, LOCATION","463, 468, ACTION","86, 90, MODAL","2, 13, LOCATION"}
10270	Ø The sections of the manuscript in its actual form are not according to the ones recommended by the Resources MDPI Journal's Template. The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the above-mentioned template that provides a more logical structure that is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to better express the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review should be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5. Conclusions (not mandatory), 6.

10271	Ø The "Introduction" section – extending the presentation of the current state of knowledge. In the "Introduction" section, the authors must introduce a presentation of the current state of the research field by reviewing it carefully and by citing other key publications. By doing so, the problem will be put into context and it will benefit the readers as well. The purpose of the literature survey is to highlight for each of the involved referenced papers the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the methods used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article. This is the only way to contextualize the current state of the art in which the authors of the manuscript position their paper and address aspects that have not been tackled/solved yet by the existing studies from the body of knowledge in contrast with the manuscript under review.	{"367, 400, CONTENT","151, 271, CONTENT","867, 975, CONTENT","985, 995, LOCATION","6, 28, LOCATION","100, 122, LOCATION","141, 150, ACTION","298, 302, MODAL","309, 322, CONTENT","330, 334, MODAL","334, 342, ACTION","342, 354, CONTENT","407, 417, ACTION","834, 842, ACTION","843, 855, CONTENT","859, 866, ACTION","306, 309, ACTION","421, 727, CONTENT","136, 140, MODAL","798, 803, TRIGGER"}
10272	Ø Line 31, the "Introduction" section – identifying a gap in the current state of knowledge. In the "Introduction" section, after having performed the appropriate review of the scientific articles/studies that tackle similar or related problems with the one of the manuscript, the authors must identify and state clearly in the manuscript a gap in the current state of knowledge that they intend to fill with their proposed approach. The same gap must also be tackled afterwards, in the "Discussion" section of the manuscript as well, where the authors should justify why their approach fills the identified gap in rapport with previous studies from the literature. In addition to these aspects, at the end of the Introduction, the authors should present the structure of their paper, under the form: "The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 contains…".	{"289, 293, MODAL","468, 478, TRIGGER","2, 9, LOCATION","328, 338, LOCATION","696, 726, LOCATION","15, 37, LOCATION","755, 871, CONTENT","747, 755, ACTION","100, 122, LOCATION","294, 303, ACTION","307, 313, ACTION","341, 432, CONTENT","447, 452, MODAL","740, 747, MODAL","578, 666, CONTENT","460, 467, ACTION","487, 507, LOCATION","553, 560, MODAL","560, 568, ACTION"}
10273	Ø Line 82, the "Materials and Methods" section. I consider that it will benefit the manuscript if the authors include a "Materials and Methods" section (in the actual form of the manuscript this section is missing), in which the new developed methods should be described  in detail while well-established methods (and information) can be briefly described and appropriately cited . In order to help the readers better understand the methodology of the conducted study, in the "Materials and Methods" section the authors should devise a flowchart that depicts the steps that they have processed in developing  their research and most important of all, the final target. This flowchart will facilitate the understanding of the proposed approach and it will make the article more interesting  to the reader if used as a graphical abstract. In addition to flowchart, in order to bring a benefit to the manuscript, the authors should state and justify very clear in the "Materials and Methods" section the choices they have made when developing the final form of their proposed approach. The authors should state what has justified using  this approach, what is special, unexpected, or different in their research methodology. It will benefit if the authors mention if they have tried other approaches that in the end led them to the current form of their research design.	{"922, 929, MODAL","764, 835, CONTENT","755, 759, ACTION","750, 755, MODAL","704, 743, CONTENT","689, 700, ACTION","117, 151, CONTENT","178, 189, LOCATION","190, 202, LOCATION","206, 213, ACTION","1264, 1367, CONTENT","1230, 1237, CONTENT","1261, 1263, TRIGGER","1253, 1261, ACTION","1225, 1230, MODAL","1154, 1221, CONTENT","939, 947, ACTION","929, 935, ACTION","536, 667, CONTENT","684, 689, MODAL","1149, 1154, TRIGGER","15, 46, LOCATION","229, 249, CONTENT","251, 257, MODAL","261, 270, ACTION","281, 287, TRIGGER","1113, 1147, CONTENT","287, 331, CONTENT","331, 334, MODAL","345, 355, ACTION","374, 379, ACTION","476, 507, LOCATION","520, 527, MODAL","527, 534, ACTION","1108, 1113, TRIGGER","1102, 1108, ACTION","1095, 1102, MODAL","1001, 1082, CONTENT","871, 908, CONTENT","965, 996, LOCATION","67, 71, MODAL","219, 224, TRIGGER","2, 9, LOCATION","110, 117, ACTION"}

10276	Ø Line 337, comment regarding the dataset. According to the information contained in Table 1, the authors have analyzed data from 1934 to 2012. I do not contradict the importance of historical data (between 1934 and 1989), but I consider that the authors should have also analyzed more recent data. I would like the authors to comment in the paper whether the data collected previously (the authors state in Table 1 that the contemporary period is the one ranging between 2003 and 2012) are still relevant today, in 2019, in what concerns the same problem. The authors should provide explanations whether their study is consistent, whether the changes that may occur within the older dataset from the above-mentioned period and the current year risk altering the final result. The authors must provide more details regarding the way in which they have solved the problems related to missing  data or abnormal values if they are to occur.	{"2, 10, LOCATION","223, 226, TRIGGER","255, 261, MODAL","584, 775, CONTENT","576, 584, ACTION","569, 576, MODAL","408, 415, LOCATION","487, 511, CONTENT","327, 335, ACTION","301, 307, MODAL","272, 297, CONTENT","342, 347, LOCATION","262, 267, ACTION","360, 385, CONTENT","85, 92, LOCATION","806, 937, CONTENT","794, 802, ACTION","789, 794, MODAL"}
10278	Ø The citations within the paper. The references [13] and [58] are first cited at Line 97, after the first citation of reference [9] at Line 92. Therefore, the references are not cited in an ascending order. The same issue has occurred many times in the paper.

10281	Ø The Figures' citation within the paper. According to the MDPI Resources Journal's Template, all the figures should be cited  in the main text as Figure 1, Figure 2, etc. In the manuscript under review, the figures' citations appear sometimes in the main text as "Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3…". Please address this issue by modifying the way in which the figures are referred in the main text, according to the Journal's Template.	{"298, 305, ACTION","251, 260, LOCATION","178, 189, LOCATION","134, 143, LOCATION","102, 110, LOCATION","204, 226, CONTENT","227, 234, ACTION","264, 289, LOCATION","147, 165, CONTENT","306, 425, CONTENT","119, 125, ACTION","110, 116, MODAL"}
10282	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: sustainability-536177, with the title "Findings from a pilot LED bulb exchange program at a neighborhood scale". In this paper, the authors present a pilot project, involving the exchanging of LED bulbs in Salt Lake City. The authors discuss a series of findings about which they state that will help shape future community-based models so that they are appropriately deployed and more effective in alleviating local energy insecurity.	{"20, 30, LOCATION","73, 146, LOCATION","151, 161, LOCATION"}

10285	Ø Remarks regarding the sections of the manuscript. In the actual form of the paper, its sections are not according to the ones recommended by the template of the MDPI Sustainability Journal. The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the above-mentioned template that provides a more logical structure that is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to express better the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review should be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5. Conclusions (not mandatory), 6. Patents (not mandatory), Supplementary Materials (not mandatory), Author Contributions, Funding, Acknowledgments, Conflicts of Interest, Appendices and References.	{"233, 235, TRIGGER","462, 470, ACTION","89, 97, LOCATION","421, 431, LOCATION","396, 413, CONTENT","254, 394, CONTENT","621, 628, MODAL","196, 206, LOCATION","477, 577, CONTENT","442, 447, ACTION","657, 944, CONTENT","631, 645, ACTION","242, 254, ACTION","432, 437, MODAL","106, 190, CONTENT","77, 83, LOCATION","98, 105, ACTION","220, 224, MODAL","40, 50, LOCATION"}
10286	Ø Lines 9-26, the "Abstract" of the paper. Taking into consideration that this is a research article, the abstract should offer a relevant overview of the work. It will benefit the paper if the authors provide a structured abstract, that covers the following aspects: the background (in which the authors should place the issue that the manuscript addresses in a broad context and highlight the purpose of the study), the methods used to solve the identified issue (that should be briefly described ), a summary of the article's main findings followed by the main conclusions or interpretations. In the abstract the authors must also declare and briefly justify the novelty of their work. In the actual form of the manuscript, the abstract offers information related only to some of these aspects and even so, their delimitation is unclear.	{"2, 12, LOCATION","115, 121, MODAL","287, 292, TRIGGER","312, 318, ACTION","662, 687, CONTENT","654, 662, ACTION","634, 642, ACTION","624, 629, MODAL","504, 594, CONTENT","318, 415, CONTENT","305, 312, MODAL","187, 189, TRIGGER","202, 210, ACTION","164, 168, MODAL","130, 159, CONTENT","122, 128, ACTION","731, 739, LOCATION","715, 725, LOCATION","603, 611, LOCATION","489, 498, ACTION","471, 477, MODAL","418, 464, CONTENT","210, 282, CONTENT","106, 114, LOCATION","36, 41, LOCATION","18, 28, LOCATION"}
10287	Ø Lines 63-73, the "Introduction" section. "Several studies have focused on the wintertime elevated PM2.5 (Baasandorj et al., 2017; Bares et al., 2018) and summertime elevated ozone (Horel et al., 2016; Lareau et al., 2012) levels in the Salt Lake Valley. Using a state-of-the-art mobile observation platform that includes instrumentation mounted on light rail trains (Mitchell et al., 2018) and a news helicopter (Blaylock, Horel, & Crosman, 2017), large spatial and temporal gradients in pollutant concentrations have been observed across Salt Lake County. The health impacts of poor air quality in Utah range from high incidences of pneumonia (Pirozzi et al., 2018), to increased hospitalizations due to respiratory issues (Horne et al., 2018). Furthermore, emerging associations between poor air quality and negative health outcomes such as pre-term births (Hackmann & Sjöberg, 2016) and suicides (Bakian et al., 2015) have been found in the Salt Lake Valley and Utah, furthering the importance of pollutant reduction strategies." I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 10 (like the authors have did) or even more scientific works in a few lines just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section. In the "Introduction" section, the authors must introduce a presentation of the current state of the research field by reviewing it carefully and by citing more other key publications. By doing so, the problem will be put into context and it will benefit the readers as well. The purpose of the literature survey is to highlight for each of the involved referenced papers the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the method used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article. This is the only way to contextualize the current state of the art in which the authors of the manuscript position their paper and address aspects that have not been tackled/solved yet by the existing studies.	{"1262, 1284, LOCATION","1303, 1313, ACTION","1465, 1470, MODAL","1054, 1072, ACTION","1081, 1092, LOCATION","1092, 1176, CONTENT","1235, 1253, LOCATION","1313, 1438, CONTENT","1473, 1476, ACTION","1989, 1999, LOCATION","1477, 1489, CONTENT","43, 1034, LOCATION","19, 41, LOCATION","1932, 1961, CONTENT","1918, 1932, ACTION","1497, 1502, MODAL","2025, 2033, ACTION","2033, 2102, CONTENT","1298, 1302, MODAL","2, 13, LOCATION"}
10288	Ø The "Introduction" section. In the "Introduction" section, the authors must clearly specify the gap in the current state of knowledge that they intend to fill with their proposed approach. The same gap must be analyzed afterwards, in the "Discussion" section of the manuscript (which is currently missing from the manuscript) as well, where the authors should justify why their approach fills the identified gap in rapport with previous studies from the literature. In the "Introduction" section the authors must also declare the novel aspects of their work.	{"221, 231, TRIGGER","86, 93, ACTION","73, 77, MODAL","355, 362, MODAL","370, 466, CONTENT","475, 497, LOCATION","510, 515, MODAL","520, 528, ACTION","528, 559, CONTENT","191, 203, CONTENT","94, 189, CONTENT","268, 278, LOCATION","299, 306, ACTION","316, 326, LOCATION","240, 260, LOCATION","204, 209, MODAL","212, 221, ACTION","337, 343, TRIGGER","362, 370, ACTION","6, 28, LOCATION","37, 59, LOCATION"}

10291	Ø The "Materials and Methods" section. In order to help the readers better understand the methodology of the conducted study, in the "Materials and Methods" section, the authors should devise a flowchart that depicts the steps that they have processed in developing  their research and most important of all, the final target. This flowchart will facilitate the understanding  of the proposed approach. This diagram should be analyzed in detail within the manuscript by specifying all the elements needed  for each and every step, in order to reach the final result of the study.	{"456, 466, LOCATION","178, 184, MODAL","467, 578, CONTENT","192, 325, CONTENT","327, 341, CONTENT","342, 347, MODAL","347, 357, ACTION","408, 415, CONTENT","435, 444, CONTENT","6, 37, LOCATION","133, 164, LOCATION","185, 192, ACTION","362, 401, CONTENT","416, 423, MODAL","426, 435, ACTION"}

10294	Ø Remark regarding the data collection. Regarding the devised survey, I consider that the information provided in this section about the questionnaire, the respondents and the responses must be precisely anchored  in a certain moment of time taking into account the fact that it is possible that a part of the information might change in time, otherwise the whole study risks to become inconsistent and irrelevant.	{"204, 212, ACTION","90, 186, CONTENT","186, 190, MODAL"}
10295	Ø The "Discussion" section. In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Discussion" section (which is currently missing from the manuscript), the authors should make a comparison between their approach from the manuscript and other similar ones that have been developed in the literature for the same or related purposes. There are a lot of valuable studies in the scientific literature related to the subject of the manuscript to which the authors can compare to and this comparison will highlight even more the novel aspects that their paper brought in contrast to the existing   studies.	{"173, 179, MODAL","40, 49, ACTION","90, 110, LOCATION","180, 185, ACTION","186, 339, CONTENT","450, 456, TRIGGER","468, 472, MODAL","472, 480, ACTION","49, 81, CONTENT","487, 502, CONTENT","503, 508, MODAL","508, 518, ACTION","523, 608, CONTENT","341, 446, CONTENT","131, 138, ACTION","148, 158, LOCATION","6, 26, LOCATION"}
10296	Ø The "Discussion" section.

10297	Ø The "Discussion" section. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their analysis and provide an insight at the end of the "Discussion" section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained results, the most important, appropriate and concrete actions that the decisional factors and all the involved parties should take in order to benefit from the results of the research conducted within the manuscript as to attain the ultimate goal of sustainability.	{"148, 186, LOCATION","54, 58, MODAL","388, 509, CONTENT","371, 384, ACTION","364, 370, MODAL","339, 363, CONTENT","187, 334, CONTENT","129, 137, ACTION","137, 147, CONTENT","82, 87, ACTION","6, 26, LOCATION","89, 124, CONTENT"}
10298	Ø Lines 636-655, the "Conclusions" section. " Despite the UCE pilot’s success in terms of emissions reductions and participation, analysis of participants’ demographic data indicates that participants in the UCE pilot were not representative of the ethnic and income demographics of the target ZIP Codes. Several factors may have contributed to this result, including: the distance of UCE pilot event locations from public transit, the lack of culturally relevant messaging, the lack of Spanish-speaking staff at events, and the lack of trusted messengers participating in events. To address the lack of demographic representation among participants, subsequent expansion efforts should include more direct engagement with trusted members of the targeted communities and stronger attempts to engage participants in energy efficiency education.". It is beneficial for this study the fact that the authors have admitted their failure to attract demographically representative participants in their study, have analyzed possible reasons that have caused and potential ways to address this lack in the future, but I consider that the authors must explain if this failure did not affect the relevance of their study. Indeed, the research design of the study concerning an appropriate choosing methodology of the representative samples of the population is a major drawback of the research reported in the manuscript.	{"1138, 1143, MODAL","21, 42, LOCATION","44, 844, LOCATION","1106, 1110, TRIGGER","1151, 1154, TRIGGER","1154, 1210, CONTENT","1143, 1151, ACTION","1400, 1410, LOCATION","2, 15, LOCATION"}

10307	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: resources-478551, with the title "Determining of Health Index of Transmission Line Asset using Condition-Based Method". In this paper, starting from the premises that the assessment on overhead transmission lines is a crucial task in the asset management of electric power infrastructures, the authors present the development of a health index of the transmission line using a condition-based method. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors address within the manuscript the following  aspects:	{"462, 466, MODAL","509, 519, LOCATION","20, 30, LOCATION","68, 153, LOCATION","475, 478, TRIGGER","490, 498, ACTION","524, 542, CONTENT"}
10308	Ø General remarks about the paper. The Manuscript ID: resources-478551 is interesting, but it still remains an aspect that must be clarified  by the authors, namely the fact that they must assume more clearly their own results. I consider that the authors must assume more clearly in the paper their original contribution by specifying this fact and by highlighting the fact that starting from a certain point there are presented the original and novel aspects of their research. The authors must state more clearly their original methods, their original results and conclusions, the novelty of their study. In the current form of the paper, this aspect is unclear.	{"256, 261, MODAL","492, 497, MODAL","497, 503, ACTION","184, 189, MODAL","108, 117, CONTENT","189, 196, ACTION","196, 226, CONTENT","261, 268, ACTION","300, 478, CONTENT","87, 90, TRIGGER","123, 127, MODAL","130, 140, ACTION","39, 49, LOCATION","635, 639, LOCATION","522, 606, CONTENT","288, 293, LOCATION"}
10309	Ø Lines 14-28, the Abstract of the paper.

10310	Ø The sections of the manuscript in its actual form are not according to the ones recommended by the Resources MDPI Journal's Template. The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the above-mentioned template that provides a more logical structure that is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to better express the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review should be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5. Conclusions (not mandatory), 6.

10311	Ø Lines 41-42, the "Introduction" section. "Figure 1 shows the compilation of performance report from the Malaysia Energy Commission from 2000 to 2016 [1],[3] - [4] - [11], [12], [13]." I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 6 (like the authors have did) or even more scientific works in two lines just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the "References" section. In the "Introduction" section, the authors must introduce a presentation of the current state of the research field by reviewing it carefully and by citing other key publications. By doing so, the problem will be put into context and it will benefit the readers as well. The purpose of the literature survey is to highlight for each of the involved referenced papers the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the methods used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article. This is the only way to contextualize the current state of the art in which the authors of the manuscript position their paper and address aspects that have not been tackled/solved yet by the existing studies.	{"448, 452, MODAL","205, 223, ACTION","232, 242, LOCATION","1135, 1145, LOCATION","647, 654, ACTION","243, 324, CONTENT","383, 403, LOCATION","1078, 1106, CONTENT","1064, 1077, ACTION","463, 583, CONTENT","2, 13, LOCATION","1110, 1115, TRIGGER","642, 647, MODAL","43, 186, LOCATION","412, 434, LOCATION","453, 463, ACTION","598, 609, CONTENT","610, 615, MODAL","1179, 1248, CONTENT","1171, 1179, ACTION","618, 622, ACTION","19, 41, LOCATION","622, 634, CONTENT"}

10313	Ø The "Materials and Methods" section. In order to bring a benefit to the manuscript, the authors should state and justify very clear in the "Materials and Methods" section (which is currently missing from the manuscript), preferably within the first paragraph, the choices they have made when developing the final form of their proposed approach. The authors should state what has justified using  this approach, what is special, unexpected, or different in their research methodology. It will benefit if the authors mention if they have tried other approaches that in the end led them to the current form of their research design.	{"174, 179, TRIGGER","490, 494, MODAL","74, 84, LOCATION","193, 200, ACTION","210, 220, LOCATION","245, 260, LOCATION","98, 104, MODAL","105, 111, ACTION","115, 123, ACTION","141, 172, LOCATION","266, 346, CONTENT","360, 367, MODAL","367, 373, ACTION","373, 378, TRIGGER","382, 412, CONTENT","414, 419, TRIGGER","422, 485, CONTENT","518, 526, ACTION","526, 529, TRIGGER","539, 631, CONTENT","6, 37, LOCATION"}
10314	Ø The "Materials and Methods" section. In order to help the readers better understand the methodology of the conducted study, in the "Materials and Methods" section (which is currently missing from the manuscript) the authors should devise a flowchart that depicts the steps that they have processed in developing  their research and most important of all, the final target. This flowchart will facilitate the understanding of the proposed approach and in the same time it will make the article more interesting  for the readers if used as a graphical abstract.	{"233, 240, ACTION","6, 37, LOCATION","133, 164, LOCATION","226, 233, MODAL","242, 373, CONTENT","395, 406, ACTION","410, 448, CONTENT","473, 478, MODAL","478, 483, ACTION","166, 171, TRIGGER","390, 394, MODAL","185, 192, ACTION","202, 212, LOCATION","483, 560, CONTENT"}
10315	Ø The equations within the manuscript should be explained , demonstrated or cited, as there are some equations that have not been introduced in the literature for the first time by the authors and that are not cited.	{"96, 110, CONTENT","2, 15, CONTENT","141, 177, CONTENT","202, 215, ACTION","47, 57, ACTION","38, 44, MODAL","116, 140, ACTION","27, 37, LOCATION","76, 81, ACTION","60, 73, ACTION"}
10316	Ø The "Results" section. According to the Resources MDPI Journal's Template, it is recommended that a research paper contain among other sections, a "Results" one. In the actual form of the paper, this section is missing. In this section the authors should provide a concise and precise description of their obtained results, their interpretation as well as the conclusions that can be drawn. The authors must highlight their original results as in the actual form of the paper they are insufficiently detailed and it seem to reduce to only one table, at the end of the "Discussion" section.	{"196, 209, CONTENT","102, 162, CONTENT","6, 23, LOCATION","410, 420, ACTION","426, 442, CONTENT","213, 220, ACTION","267, 391, CONTENT","257, 265, ACTION","405, 410, MODAL","250, 256, MODAL","552, 590, LOCATION","38, 75, CONTENT","83, 94, ACTION"}
10318	Ø The "Discussion" section. It will benefit the paper if the authors elaborate in this section a cost-benefit analysis regarding the implementation of their proposed solution in a daily operating environment, taking into account all the involved costs. This cost-benefit analysis is necessary in order to prove that the devised solution is feasible to be implemented on a large scale and used on a daily basis from the economic point of view, taking into consideration also the maintenance costs. Consequently, the cost-benefit analysis cannot be postponed  in a future work and must be addressed  within the current manuscript.	{"515, 536, CONTENT","579, 584, MODAL","587, 598, ACTION","547, 556, ACTION","537, 544, MODAL","320, 495, CONTENT","305, 310, ACTION","97, 251, CONTENT","82, 94, LOCATION","6, 26, LOCATION","617, 627, LOCATION","31, 35, MODAL","69, 78, ACTION","253, 292, CONTENT"}

10320	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: sustainability-512873, with the title "Machine Learning Techniques for Predicting the Energy Consumption/ Production and its Uncertainties Driven by Meteorological Observations and Forecasts". In this paper, the authors assess the suitability of several Machine Learning (ML) methodologies for predicting the energy consumption/ production and for deriving predictive uncertainties based on the information of hydro-meteorological data. The authors conclude that the obtained results highlight the importance of optimally combining different ML methods for achieving more accurate estimates of future energy consumptions and productions with sharper prediction uncertainty estimates (i.e. narrower prediction intervals).	{"20, 30, LOCATION","73, 226, LOCATION"}
10321	I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors address within the manuscript the following  aspects:	{"54, 62, ACTION","26, 31, MODAL","39, 42, TRIGGER","84, 106, CONTENT","73, 83, LOCATION"}
10322	Ø The "Abstract" of the paper. In the abstract the authors must also declare and briefly justify the novelty of their work in addition to the presented elements.	{"38, 46, LOCATION","89, 96, ACTION","59, 63, MODAL","69, 77, ACTION","6, 16, LOCATION","101, 122, CONTENT"}
10323	Ø The "Introduction" section. After declaring the novel aspects of their work, at the end of the "Introduction" section, the authors should present the structure of their paper, under the form: "The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 contains…".	{"151, 263, CONTENT","6, 28, LOCATION","133, 140, MODAL","140, 148, ACTION","86, 119, LOCATION"}
10324	Ø The "Materials and Methods" section. I consider that the authors must pay more attention to the appropriate citation of the methods and results that have been retrieved from the scientific literature. When the authors present the information in the "Materials and Methods" section, they must assume clearly their original contribution by specifying this fact and by highlighting the fact that starting  from a certain point there are depicted the original and novel aspects of their research. In order to help the readers better understand the methodology of the conducted study, in the "Materials and Methods" section the authors should devise a flowchart that depicts the steps that they have processed in developing  their research and most important of all, the final target. This flowchart will facilitate the understanding  of the proposed approach. This diagram should be analyzed in detail within the manuscript by specifying all the elements needed  for each and every step, in order to reach the final result of the study.	{"890, 899, CONTENT","71, 90, ACTION","6, 37, LOCATION","98, 201, CONTENT","251, 282, LOCATION","289, 294, MODAL","294, 301, ACTION","589, 620, LOCATION","633, 640, MODAL","640, 646, ACTION","649, 780, CONTENT","871, 878, MODAL","881, 890, ACTION","315, 493, CONTENT","67, 71, MODAL","922, 1033, CONTENT","911, 921, LOCATION"}
10325	Ø The equations within the manuscript should be explained , demonstrated or cited, as there are some equations that have not been introduced in the literature for the first time by the authors and that are not cited.	{"141, 177, CONTENT","116, 140, ACTION","96, 110, CONTENT","2, 15, CONTENT","202, 215, ACTION","27, 37, LOCATION","47, 57, ACTION","38, 44, MODAL","76, 81, ACTION","60, 73, ACTION"}
10326	Ø The "Results and Discussion" section. The manuscript under review will benefit if the authors improve the actual "Results and Discussion" section. In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Results and Discussion" section, the authors should make a comparison between their approach from the manuscript and other similar ones that have been developed in the scientific literature for the same or related purposes. In the actual form of the manuscript there is only one cited paper in the "Results and Discussion" section and even this paper was not used in an appropriate manner in order to compare the approach from the manuscript to other ones that have been developed and used for the same purpose in the literature. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their analysis and provide an insight at the end of the "Results and Discussion" section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained results, the most important, appropriate and concrete actions that the decisional factors and all the involved parties should take in order to benefit from the results of the research conducted within the manuscript as to attain the ultimate goal of sustainability.	{"271, 434, CONTENT","1097, 1110, ACTION","1110, 1236, CONTENT","1090, 1097, MODAL","869, 912, LOCATION","851, 861, CONTENT","843, 851, ACTION","803, 838, CONTENT","796, 801, ACTION","768, 773, MODAL","576, 600, CONTENT","563, 575, ACTION","6, 38, LOCATION","96, 104, ACTION","211, 243, LOCATION","257, 264, MODAL","264, 268, ACTION","510, 542, LOCATION","68, 72, MODAL","115, 147, LOCATION","161, 169, ACTION","913, 1011, CONTENT","1016, 1089, CONTENT","462, 472, LOCATION","170, 202, CONTENT"}
10327	Ø Remarks regarding the Figures. The paper contains a lot of insufficiently explained and interpreted figures (for example, Figure 1 covers the whole page 10,  Figure 2 covers the whole page 11, Figure 3 covers the whole page 12, and all these figures are commented within the same phrase, under the form: "Based on previous studies of applicability of monthly weather forecasts for the optimization of the hydro power plant production (see [54]) the meteorological data spatially aggregated for the Verzasca catchment have been used as a surrogate for the canton Ticino (see Figure 1) and the runoff, production and consumption data are for the Canton Ticino (see Figure 2 and 3)." Similarly, page 17 contains only the Figures 6 and 7 which are commented within the same phrase, in the form: "These examples help to explain also some properties of the resulting CRPS shown in Fig. 6 and 7.", page 18 contains only Figure 8 while page 19 contains only Figure 9. The authors must explain and analyze in detail all the figures that have been inserted within the manuscript, it is not suitable to put the reader in the situation of interpreting, analyzing, continuing or refining the study from the manuscript under review.	{"124, 132, LOCATION","736, 741, TRIGGER","1060, 1070, LOCATION","999, 1048, CONTENT","195, 203, LOCATION","160, 168, LOCATION","24, 31, LOCATION","893, 900, LOCATION","793, 891, LOCATION","694, 701, LOCATION","306, 682, LOCATION","221, 228, LOCATION","186, 193, LOCATION","150, 157, LOCATION","915, 923, LOCATION","991, 999, ACTION","979, 987, ACTION","974, 979, MODAL","930, 937, LOCATION","720, 735, LOCATION","952, 960, LOCATION"}
10328	Ø Remarks regarding the Figures' citation. According to the Sustainability MDPI Journal's Template, all the figures should be cited  in the main text as Figure 1, Figure 2, etc. In the manuscript under review, there are different ways in which this information appears (sometimes in the main text appears "Fig…", sometimes appears "Figure…") Please address this issue by modifying the way in which the figures are referred in the main text.	{"381, 422, CONTENT","371, 381, ACTION","357, 367, CONTENT","349, 357, ACTION","24, 41, LOCATION","185, 195, LOCATION","305, 311, LOCATION","331, 340, LOCATION","430, 439, LOCATION","150, 176, CONTENT","100, 115, CONTENT","140, 149, LOCATION","125, 131, ACTION","116, 122, MODAL"}
10329	Ø Remarks regarding the acquired dataset. In the Section "3. Data", the authors state: "The data are provided spatially aggregated for each canton in Switzerland with 15 minutes resolution starting from the year 2015." I would like the authors to explain what is the timeframe to which the data refer. The authors must provide more details regarding the way in which they intend to solve the problems related to missing  data or abnormal values if they are to occur.	{"80, 85, ACTION","260, 300, CONTENT","255, 259, TRIGGER","221, 226, MODAL","87, 218, LOCATION","332, 357, CONTENT","319, 327, ACTION","314, 319, MODAL","247, 255, ACTION","361, 367, TRIGGER","49, 66, LOCATION","371, 465, CONTENT"}
10330	Ø Remarks regarding the chosen case study. In the "Introduction" section, the authors state: "The coupling of energy models with numerical weather forecast models has been propagated by [14], but by the best knowledge of the authors no monthly ensemble prediction system has been applied so far. This will be done the first time in this paper for a region of Switzerland." The authors should highlight more the generalization capability of their approach in order to be able to justify a wider contribution that has been brought to the current state of art. In addition to this, the authors should explain in the article if (and why) only a single case study is sufficient in order to validate the generalization capability of the proposed approach.	{"392, 402, ACTION","385, 392, MODAL","93, 372, LOCATION","50, 72, LOCATION","639, 748, CONTENT","629, 632, TRIGGER","621, 624, TRIGGER","598, 606, ACTION","591, 598, MODAL","407, 556, CONTENT"}
10331	Ø Remarks regarding the results. In the Section "5. Conclusions and Outlook", the authors state: "Thus several ML methods have been compared with an emphasis on the estimated predictive uncertainties, a highly relevant information for the end-users to aid effective decision making, which is most often neglected in the ML applications. Therefore not only the accuracy of the predictions has been verified by the Coefficient of Determination (resp. the Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency Measure), but also the predictive uncertainty has been evaluated by the Continuous Rank Probability Score. As benchmark models the Multiple Linear Regression and the Quantile Regression Models have been used in order to see the possible gains in applying computational more intense models." In accordance to this paragraph, the authors state that the main outcome of this paper is a benchmark of pre-existing methods. I consider that these sentences should be nuanced , refined, because in their actual form, the original contribution of the current paper is not sufficiently highlighted.	{"929, 935, MODAL","787, 801, LOCATION","992, 1066, CONTENT","949, 956, ACTION","939, 947, ACTION","97, 769, LOCATION","40, 76, LOCATION"}
10332	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: energies-627811, having the title "Techno-economic Analysis of a Novel Two-stage Flashing Process for Acid Gas Removal from Natural Gas". In this paper, in order to enrich CO2 and reduce regenerator energy consumption, the authors propose a two-stage flashing process. The authors have used the Aspen HYSYS dynamic process simulation software in order to simulate the two-stage flashing process. The proposed process was compared with conventional acid gas removal process, as well as the combination of acid gas removal and acid gas enrichment processes. In addition, Aspen HYSYS sensitivity analysis function was used to study the effect of different operation parameters on the overall energy consumption. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors address within the manuscript the following  aspects:	{"798, 806, ACTION","770, 775, MODAL","69, 171, LOCATION","20, 31, LOCATION","832, 850, CONTENT","817, 828, LOCATION"}
10333	The sections of the manuscript in its actual form are not according to the ones recommended by the Energies MDPI Journal's Template. The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the above-mentioned template that provides a more logical structure, which is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to express better the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review should be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5. Conclusions (not mandatory), 6. Patents (not mandatory), Supplementary Materials (not mandatory), Author Contributions, Funding, Acknowledgments, Conflicts of Interest, Appendices and References.	{"405, 412, ACTION","540, 550, LOCATION","50, 57, ACTION","4, 12, LOCATION","20, 30, LOCATION","161, 165, MODAL","58, 131, CONTENT","137, 147, LOCATION","199, 337, CONTENT","364, 374, LOCATION","420, 520, CONTENT","375, 380, MODAL","183, 196, ACTION","343, 357, ACTION","564, 571, MODAL","574, 586, ACTION","600, 887, CONTENT"}
10334	Lines 46-56, the "Introduction" section. In its current form, the "Introduction" section contains a series of cited papers. I do not contradict the value of these papers, or their relevance in this context, but I consider that the article under review will benefit if the authors extend this section by analyzing appropriately the cited papers and by analyzing  more other papers in order to contextualize their study. The literature review of the cited papers has been performed mostly in the following manner: "Membrane separation is another method has been used for natural gas sweetening [7-10]. Other methods include but are not limited to biochemical method [11], molecular sieving [12,13], and low-temperature fractionation [14,15]. Among those technologies listed above, chemical absorption is the most widely used method for acid gas removal. Various amines have been commonly used as chemical solvents, such as monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), and methyldiethanolamine (MDEA). Compared with MEA and DEA, MDEA can selectively remove H2S with the existence of CO2. Secondly, MDEA can remove most CO2 and H2S from the raw natural gas, it can be beneficial to sulfur recovery. Thirdly, the foaming tendency and corrosiveness of MDEA are lower compared to MEA and DEA. Last but not least, the reaction of MDEA with CO2 is an acid-base reaction with less heat of reaction, thus less heat is needed during regeneration, so it is ideal for removing CO2 in large quantities [16-18].". I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 12 (like the authors have did) or even more scientific works in a few lines just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section. In the "Introduction" section, the authors must introduce a presentation of the current state of the research field by reviewing it carefully and by citing other key publications. By doing so, the problem will be put into context and it will benefit the readers as well. The purpose of the literature survey is to highlight for the involved referenced papers the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the methods used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article. This is the only way to contextualize the current state of the art in which the authors of the manuscript position their paper and address aspects that have not been tackled/solved yet by the existing studies from the body of knowledge in contrast with the manuscript under review.	{"1932, 1936, ACTION","1924, 1929, MODAL","1767, 1777, ACTION","1762, 1767, MODAL","1726, 1748, LOCATION","512, 1497, LOCATION","287, 299, LOCATION","280, 287, ACTION","252, 256, MODAL","17, 39, LOCATION","2485, 2626, CONTENT","2477, 2485, ACTION","2370, 2384, ACTION","2033, 2043, ACTION","1956, 1961, MODAL","1936, 1948, CONTENT","2384, 2412, CONTENT","1990, 2026, CONTENT","1777, 1897, CONTENT","1699, 1717, LOCATION","1556, 1640, CONTENT","1545, 1555, LOCATION","1518, 1536, ACTION","300, 417, CONTENT","66, 88, LOCATION","207, 210, TRIGGER","0, 11, LOCATION","2441, 2451, LOCATION","2047, 2344, CONTENT"}

It will benefit the paper if the authors restructure their paper and devise a proper "Materials and Methods" section, as requested by the Energies MDPI Journal's Template. I consider that the authors must pay more attention to the appropriate citation of the methods and results that have been retrieved from the scientific literature. When the authors present the information in the "Materials and Methods" section, they must assume clearly their original contribution by specifying this fact and by highlighting the fact that starting  from a certain point there are depicted the original and novel aspects of their research.	{"545, 550, MODAL","550, 557, ACTION","571, 592, CONTENT","596, 607, ACTION","607, 616, CONTENT","624, 636, ACTION","353, 457, CONTENT","328, 346, ACTION","323, 327, MODAL","182, 293, CONTENT","4, 35, LOCATION","79, 110, CONTENT","641, 750, CONTENT","164, 176, ACTION","503, 538, LOCATION","476, 484, ACTION","459, 463, TRIGGER","126, 130, MODAL","114, 121, ACTION","63, 73, LOCATION"}
10337	The "Materials and Methods" section. The authors must improve the mathematical formalism and pay more attention to the details. As the paper under review refers to technical problems, it should contain a mathematical support regarding  the devised approach, chemical reactions and proper explanations of the chemical processes that occur. The equations should be explained , demonstrated or cited, as a part of the involved equations have not been introduced in the literature for the first time by the authors. The current form of the paper does not contain any equation or chemical reaction.	{"460, 510, CONTENT","401, 433, CONTENT","49, 53, MODAL","433, 458, ACTION","353, 359, MODAL","4, 35, LOCATION","54, 62, ACTION","66, 88, CONTENT","93, 111, ACTION","115, 126, CONTENT","187, 194, MODAL","194, 202, ACTION","204, 337, CONTENT","343, 352, CONTENT","363, 372, ACTION","375, 388, ACTION","391, 396, ACTION","516, 541, CONTENT","542, 558, ACTION","563, 592, CONTENT"}
10338	The "Materials and Methods" section. In addition to the flowchart, in order to bring a benefit to the manuscript, the authors should state and justify very clear in the "Materials and Methods" section the choices they have made when developing the final form of their proposed approach. The authors should state what has justified using  this approach, what is special, unexpected, or different in their research methodology. It will benefit if the authors mention if they have tried other approaches that in the end led them to the current form of their research design.	{"4, 35, LOCATION","442, 445, TRIGGER","434, 441, CONTENT","358, 424, CONTENT","353, 358, TRIGGER","321, 351, CONTENT","312, 317, TRIGGER","306, 312, ACTION","299, 306, MODAL","169, 200, LOCATION","143, 151, ACTION","132, 139, ACTION","126, 132, MODAL","468, 570, CONTENT","457, 465, ACTION","102, 112, LOCATION","201, 285, CONTENT","429, 433, MODAL"}

10340	The "Results" section. In the "Results" section (which is currently missing from the manuscript), the authors should provide a concise and precise description of their obtained results and their interpretation.	{"117, 125, ACTION","30, 48, LOCATION","4, 21, LOCATION","127, 209, CONTENT","85, 95, LOCATION","49, 54, TRIGGER","110, 116, MODAL","68, 75, ACTION"}
10341	The "Results" section. It will benefit the paper if the authors elaborate in this section a cost-benefit analysis regarding the implementation of their proposed solution in a daily operating environment, taking into account all the involved costs. This cost-benefit analysis is necessary in order to prove that the devised solution is feasible to be implemented on a large scale and used on a daily basis from the economic point of view, taking into consideration also the maintenance costs.	{"64, 73, ACTION","77, 89, LOCATION","26, 30, MODAL","90, 246, CONTENT","315, 436, CONTENT","253, 287, CONTENT","4, 21, LOCATION","300, 306, ACTION"}
10342	The "Discussion" section. In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Discussion" section (which is currently missing from the manuscript), the authors should make a comparison between their approach from the manuscript and other similar ones that have been developed in the literature for the same or related purposes. There are a lot of valuable studies in the scientific literature related to the subject of the manuscript to which the authors can compare to and this comparison will highlight even more the novel aspects that their paper brought in contrast to the existing   studies.	{"38, 47, ACTION","4, 24, LOCATION","47, 79, CONTENT","88, 108, LOCATION","178, 183, ACTION","185, 337, CONTENT","110, 115, TRIGGER","434, 444, LOCATION","146, 156, LOCATION","129, 136, ACTION","171, 177, MODAL"}
10343	The "Discussion" section.

10344	The "Discussion" section. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their analysis and provide an insight at the end of the "Discussion" section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained results, the most important, appropriate and concrete actions that the decisional factors and all the involved parties should take in order to benefit from the results of the research conducted within the manuscript.	{"362, 369, MODAL","138, 145, CONTENT","149, 184, LOCATION","369, 382, ACTION","4, 24, LOCATION","80, 85, ACTION","87, 122, CONTENT","127, 135, ACTION","288, 360, CONTENT","383, 436, CONTENT","184, 283, CONTENT","52, 56, MODAL","448, 458, LOCATION"}
10345	Other remarks. The authors should pay more attention to the spelling , grammar and style as several errors have occurred. For example:	{"34, 52, ACTION","56, 88, CONTENT","27, 33, MODAL"}
10346	After having assessed the suitability for publication of the Manuscript ID: energies-347836, having the title "Low Carbon Energy Transitions in the Nordic Countries: Evidence from the Environmental Kuznets Curve", I have distinguished several elements that from my point of view should be made less confused  and more comprehensible by the authors in view of improving the quality of the manuscript.	{"110, 212, LOCATION","294, 333, CONTENT","289, 294, ACTION","235, 251, CONTENT","61, 71, LOCATION","279, 285, MODAL","388, 398, LOCATION"}

10348	Ø Comments regarding the sections of the manuscript:	{"41, 51, LOCATION","25, 33, LOCATION"}
10349	§   The article’s structure should be improved in order to make the article more comprehensible as in its current form it is not structured  appropriately. The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the MDPI Energies Journal's Template that provides a more logical structure that is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to better express the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review should be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5. Conclusions (not mandatory), 6. Patents (not mandatory), Supplementary Materials (not mandatory), Author Contributions, Funding, Acknowledgments, Conflicts of Interest, Appendices and References.	{"569, 579, LOCATION","160, 170, LOCATION","28, 34, MODAL","4, 27, CONTENT","38, 46, ACTION","219, 366, CONTENT","368, 385, CONTENT","393, 403, LOCATION","629, 916, CONTENT","414, 419, ACTION","603, 617, ACTION","593, 600, MODAL","431, 549, CONTENT","404, 409, MODAL","206, 219, ACTION","197, 200, TRIGGER","184, 189, MODAL","59, 154, CONTENT"}
10350	Ø Comments concerning the "Abstract" section of the paper:	{"26, 44, LOCATION"}
10351	§   In what concerns the abstract, I consider that the authors should structure it as to cover the most important points of interest: the authors should have positioned the manuscript’s topic in a broad context therefore covering appropriately the topic’s background; the authors should have presented succinctly the methods they have employed  in order to attain the purpose of their study; the authors should have summarized the most important outcomes of their study and the conclusion that one could draw. I consider that the abstract of the manuscript under review will be improved  if the authors state and explain concisely at the end of the abstract the clear contribution that their study has brought to the current state of knowledge.	{"603, 609, ACTION","570, 575, MODAL","404, 411, MODAL","158, 169, ACTION","416, 427, ACTION","146, 153, MODAL","613, 621, ACTION","280, 287, MODAL","86, 132, CONTENT","70, 80, ACTION","662, 743, CONTENT","634, 657, LOCATION","546, 556, LOCATION","169, 266, CONTENT","63, 69, MODAL","25, 33, LOCATION","302, 390, CONTENT","427, 508, CONTENT","292, 301, ACTION"}
10352	The title of the manuscript: "Carbon Emissions, Renewable Energy and Economic Growth in the ASEAN region". Acronyms must be avoided  in the title, even if they are widely known. Regarding the other acronyms used in the manuscript, they should be explained the first time when they are introduced . For example, regarding the title, the authors could modify it under the form "Carbon Emissions, Renewable Energy and Economic Growth in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region".	{"4, 9, LOCATION","271, 275, TRIGGER","375, 492, CONTENT","344, 350, MODAL","246, 255, ACTION","116, 121, MODAL","107, 116, CONTENT","124, 131, ACTION","192, 206, CONTENT","236, 243, MODAL","350, 357, ACTION","116, 120, MODAL","123, 131, ACTION","325, 330, LOCATION","29, 105, LOCATION","140, 145, LOCATION","219, 229, LOCATION","4, 9, LOCATION","231, 235, CONTENT","256, 295, CONTENT"}
10353	The font's size. At Lines 36-41, the font's size is different in contrast with the one from above or below and therefore the reading of the manuscript is affected.

10354	The pages' numbering. The pages 1-18 of the manuscript are correctly numbered, but the last page is numbered as "1 of 19". The authors should correct this inadvertence, the total number of pages is 19 and the pages numbering should be corrected .	{"142, 149, ACTION","225, 232, MODAL","235, 245, ACTION","173, 224, CONTENT","26, 36, LOCATION","135, 142, MODAL","79, 82, TRIGGER","135, 141, MODAL","135, 149, ACTION","26, 36, LOCATION","79, 83, TRIGGER","44, 54, LOCATION","87, 108, CONTENT","112, 121, LOCATION"}
10355	The citations within the manuscript are marked using round brackets instead of square brackets, under the form "(Sener, Sharp, & Anctil, 2018)" and therefore the citations are not in accordance to the recommendations of the Sustainability MDPI Journal's Template. According to this template, in the text of the manuscript, the reference numbers should be placed  in square brackets [  ] and placed before the punctuation, for example [1], [1–3] or [1,3]. For embedded citations in the text with pagination, use both parentheses and brackets to indicate the reference number and page numbers; for example [5] (p. 10), or [6] (pp. 101–105).	{"0, 67, CONTENT","67, 78, TRIGGER","79, 94, CONTENT","299, 303, LOCATION","311, 321, LOCATION","398, 420, CONTENT","25, 35, LOCATION","355, 363, ACTION","434, 453, CONTENT","391, 398, ACTION","363, 386, CONTENT","507, 511, ACTION","511, 637, CONTENT","148, 158, TRIGGER","162, 172, CONTENT","172, 193, ACTION","201, 262, CONTENT","111, 143, LOCATION","345, 351, MODAL","47, 52, ACTION","345, 352, MODAL","327, 344, CONTENT"}
10356	The "References" section. In the actual form of the manuscript, the references contained by this section are unnumbered. According to the Sustainability MDPI Journal's Template, the references must be numbered  in the order of their appearance in the text (including citations in tables and legends) and listed individually at the end of the manuscript. In the actual form of the paper, the references are ordered in an alphabetical order instead of the recommended one. Please number and reorder the references in the References section, according to the recommendations.	{"52, 62, LOCATION","105, 119, ACTION","92, 105, LOCATION","182, 193, CONTENT","193, 198, MODAL","501, 512, CONTENT","211, 299, CONTENT","304, 311, ACTION","331, 352, LOCATION","478, 485, ACTION","489, 497, ACTION","193, 197, MODAL","200, 209, ACTION","68, 78, CONTENT","4, 24, LOCATION","201, 211, ACTION","519, 537, LOCATION","413, 438, CONTENT","539, 571, CONTENT","450, 469, CONTENT","439, 449, TRIGGER","402, 413, ACTION","387, 401, CONTENT","311, 323, CONTENT"}

10360	The position of Tables and Figures. The Tables and Figures within the manuscript are positioned at the end of the paper, after the References section. Therefore, the reading of the manuscript is affected. According to the recommendations available on the Sustainability MDPI Journal website, at the section "Preparing Figures, Schemes and Tables" is specified: "All Figures, Schemes and Tables should be inserted  into the main text close to their first citation…" Please correct this aspect according to the Journal's Template.	{"27, 34, LOCATION","85, 119, CONTENT","70, 81, LOCATION","51, 59, LOCATION","40, 47, LOCATION","16, 23, LOCATION","4, 13, CONTENT","166, 203, CONTENT","151, 160, TRIGGER","131, 149, LOCATION","472, 480, ACTION","16, 22, LOCATION","308, 317, ACTION","394, 400, MODAL","480, 527, CONTENT","205, 464, CONTENT"}
10361	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: symmetry-482824, with the title "Optimum design and singularity analysis of a spatial parallel manipulator". In this paper, the author presents the optimum design and singularity analysis of a spatial 3-PPS parallel manipulator. Afterwards, the author presents a case study in order to demonstrate the implication of shape singularity. I consider that the paper will benefit if the author addresses within the manuscript the following  aspects:	{"402, 410, ACTION","410, 412, TRIGGER","147, 157, LOCATION","434, 455, LOCATION","424, 434, ACTION","20, 30, LOCATION","264, 274, TRIGGER","170, 178, ACTION","264, 274, TRIGGER","67, 142, LOCATION","20, 31, LOCATION","397, 402, MODAL","460, 478, CONTENT"}
10362	Ø First of all, I consider that the author must assume more clearly in the paper his original contribution by specifying this fact and by highlighting the fact that starting from a certain point there are presented the original and novel aspects of his research. The author must state more clearly his original methods, his original results and conclusions, the novelty of his study. In the current form of the paper, this aspect is unclear.	{"110, 120, ACTION","48, 55, ACTION","43, 48, MODAL","418, 429, CONTENT","298, 382, CONTENT","279, 285, ACTION","274, 279, MODAL","43, 47, MODAL","430, 440, ACTION","85, 261, CONTENT","75, 80, LOCATION"}
10363	Ø The sections of the manuscript in its actual form are not according to the ones recommended by the Symmetry MDPI Journal's Template. The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the above-mentioned template that provides a more logical structure that is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the author to better express the novelty of his work and the contribution that he has made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review should be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5. Conclusions (not mandatory), 6. Patents (not mandatory), Supplementary Materials (not mandatory), Author Contributions, Funding, Acknowledgments, Conflicts of Interest, Appendices and References.	{"51, 69, ACTION","168, 175, ACTION","176, 178, TRIGGER","385, 389, ACTION","73, 133, CONTENT","594, 882, CONTENT","198, 284, CONTENT","343, 357, ACTION","375, 380, MODAL","364, 375, CONTENT","163, 167, MODAL","82, 93, ACTION","6, 32, LOCATION","163, 168, MODAL","22, 32, LOCATION","185, 198, ACTION","411, 419, ACTION","423, 514, CONTENT","516, 528, TRIGGER","558, 565, MODAL","568, 582, ACTION"}
10364	Ø Lines 5-11, the Abstract of the paper. Taking into consideration that this is a research article, the abstract should offer a relevant overview of the work. It will benefit the paper if the author provides a structured abstract, that covers the following aspects: the background (in which the author should place the issue that the manuscript addresses in a broad context and highlight the purpose of the study), the methods used to solve the identified issue (that should be briefly described ), a summary of the article's main findings followed by the main conclusions or interpretations. In the abstract the author must also declare and briefly justify the novelty of his work. In the actual form of the manuscript, the abstract offers information related only to some of these aspects and even so, their delimitation is unclear.	{"266, 592, CONTENT","2, 12, LOCATION","18, 27, LOCATION","113, 120, MODAL","120, 126, ACTION","128, 157, CONTENT","104, 113, LOCATION","199, 208, ACTION","210, 229, CONTENT","600, 609, LOCATION","620, 625, MODAL","630, 638, ACTION","650, 658, ACTION","662, 681, CONTENT","2, 12, LOCATION","427, 431, ACTION","113, 119, MODAL","285, 290, TRIGGER","810, 822, CONTENT","709, 719, LOCATION","725, 733, LOCATION","734, 790, CONTENT","823, 833, ACTION"}
10365	Ø Lines 37-41, the "Introduction" section: "It is noticeable that the mechanisms mentioned in [10-15] are only a special type of the 3-PPS PMs, which did not take the shape parameters into consideration. Even the 3-PPS PM analyzed in [17], only one shape parameter is considered for the optimum design. For this reason, the 3-PPS PM is generalized with shape parameters, and two optimum configurations are obtained based on the performance evaluation with the parametric model. Shape singularity is first introduced for a planar PM in [18]…." I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 8 (like the author did) or even more scientific works in a few lines just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section. In this section, the author must introduce a presentation of the current state of the research field by reviewing it carefully and by citing key publications. By doing so, the problem will be put into context and it will benefit the readers as well. The purpose of the literature survey is to highlight for each of the involved referenced papers the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the method used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article. This is the only way to contextualize the current state of the art in which the author of the manuscript positions his paper and addresses aspects that have not been tackled/solved yet by the existing studies.	{"977, 984, ACTION","736, 754, LOCATION","636, 728, CONTENT","633, 636, TRIGGER","600, 611, CONTENT","589, 599, LOCATION","562, 580, ACTION","799, 913, CONTENT","1407, 1577, CONTENT","1393, 1406, ACTION","1369, 1389, CONTENT","1006, 1367, CONTENT","2, 13, LOCATION","19, 41, LOCATION","43, 542, LOCATION","759, 771, LOCATION","784, 789, MODAL","789, 799, ACTION","940, 945, MODAL","972, 977, MODAL","948, 952, ACTION","2, 13, LOCATION","144, 149, TRIGGER","784, 788, MODAL","81, 90, ACTION","928, 939, CONTENT","952, 964, CONTENT"}
10366	Ø The "Materials and Methods" section. It will benefit the paper if the author restructures his paper and devises a proper "Materials and methods" section (which is currently missing from the manuscript), in which the new developed methods are described in detail while well-established methods (and information) are briefly described and appropriately cited. In order to bring a benefit to the manuscript, the author should state and justify very clear in the "Materials and Methods" section, preferably within the first paragraph, the choices he has made when developing the final form of his proposed approach. The author should state what has justified using  this approach, what is special, unexpected, or different in his research methodology. It will benefit the paper if the author mentions if he has tried other approaches that in the end led him to the current form of his research design. In order to help the readers better understand the methodology of the conducted study, in the "Materials and Methods" section the author should devise a flowchart that depicts the steps that he has processed in developing  his research and most important of all, the final target. This flowchart will facilitate the understanding  of the proposed approach.	{"1216, 1255, CONTENT","1181, 1195, CONTENT","1196, 1201, MODAL","92, 102, CONTENT","79, 92, ACTION","42, 47, MODAL","6, 37, LOCATION","425, 431, ACTION","461, 492, LOCATION","505, 531, LOCATION","537, 612, CONTENT","625, 632, MODAL","632, 638, ACTION","638, 677, CONTENT","679, 748, CONTENT","790, 799, ACTION","799, 898, CONTENT","994, 1025, LOCATION","1037, 1044, MODAL","1044, 1051, ACTION","1053, 1179, CONTENT","1201, 1212, ACTION","175, 182, ACTION","156, 161, TRIGGER","42, 46, MODAL","192, 202, LOCATION","106, 114, ACTION","116, 203, CONTENT","418, 425, MODAL","435, 443, ACTION","59, 64, LOCATION","65, 67, TRIGGER","753, 757, MODAL","47, 54, ACTION","214, 358, CONTENT"}

In this paper, the author presents a model of a sensor network with energy harvesting, the network being associated with solar panels.	{"301, 328, CONTENT","20, 30, LOCATION","282, 287, MODAL","92, 97, ACTION","282, 286, MODAL","290, 301, ACTION","245, 262, CONTENT","336, 346, LOCATION","31, 113, LOCATION","20, 31, LOCATION"}
10374	The manuscript under review is interesting, documented and generally well structured, approaching a very interesting topic for the experts in the field.

10375	Remark 1. For the solar energy industry, a number of international standards have been defined. These are international standards for systems of photovoltaic plant operation and maintenance, for the design and construction phases of a photovoltaic plant, photovoltaic conversion of solar energy into electrical energy and for all the elements in the entire photovoltaic energy system. As the Manuscript ID: mathematics-983719 approaches issues regarding the networks with solar intermittent energy harvesting using Energy Packets, I consider that the author should provide precise details within the paper regarding  the degree to which his developed models can help in complying with the most important requirements as to satisfy the International Standards regarding  the solar energy devices.	{"565, 573, ACTION","606, 795, CONTENT","392, 402, LOCATION","600, 606, LOCATION","631, 636, TRIGGER","87, 94, ACTION","558, 565, MODAL","392, 403, LOCATION","573, 589, CONTENT"}
10376	Remark 2. Lines 1-8, the "Abstract" of the paper. In the "Abstract" of the paper, the author must present in a clearer manner the following  aspects: the background, the methods, the main findings, the conclusions, as in the actual form of the manuscript, the abstract offers information related only to some of these aspects and even so, their delimitation is unclear.	{"93, 98, MODAL","10, 19, LOCATION","97, 139, ACTION","57, 67, LOCATION","10, 19, LOCATION","25, 35, LOCATION","98, 106, ACTION","106, 368, CONTENT"}
10377	Remark 3. Lines 17-20, the "Introduction" section. According to these sentences, "a closed form solution must be available to study the trade-off between energy consumption and performance issues". I consider that the above-mentioned statement should be refined , reformulated and justified. Generally, in most of the real cases it is difficult to obtain the exact solutions, therefore the scientists have developed various numerical techniques which are able to provide accurate results, useful in developing a "trade-off between energy consumption and performance issues".	{"10, 21, LOCATION","281, 290, ACTION","264, 277, ACTION","218, 243, CONTENT","254, 262, ACTION","244, 251, MODAL","81, 196, LOCATION","26, 49, LOCATION","10, 21, LOCATION","224, 233, ACTION","105, 109, MODAL","445, 450, TRIGGER"}

10379	Remark 5. Lines 22-23, the "Introduction" section, the figures 1 and 2. In its actual form, the manuscript contains two insufficiently interpreted and explained figures. The author must explain and analyze in detail the figures that have been inserted within the manuscript, it is not suitable to put the reader in the situation of interpreting, analyzing, continuing or refining the study from the manuscript under review.	{"151, 160, ACTION","263, 273, LOCATION","198, 206, ACTION","216, 251, CONTENT","10, 21, LOCATION","10, 21, LOCATION","27, 49, LOCATION","55, 70, LOCATION","181, 186, MODAL","186, 194, ACTION"}
10380	Remark 6. Lines 64-136, the "Models and Product Form Solution" section. "Thus, one have two models of interaction in an EPN based on the initiator: the DP or the EP." Therefore, in order to model the types of networks that have been used in his research, the author has used two approaches. I consider that when presenting the devised approach in this section, it will be extremely helpful to design and insert a flowchart depicting the main sequence of steps that one has to process in order to provide an overview and reproduce the results of the conducted  study. This flowchart should be analyzed in detail within the manuscript by specifying all the elements needed  for each and every step, in order for one to be able to reproduce and reach the final result of the study.	{"72, 166, LOCATION","307, 311, TRIGGER","364, 368, MODAL","233, 237, ACTION","10, 22, LOCATION","622, 632, LOCATION","592, 600, ACTION","582, 589, MODAL","567, 581, CONTENT","382, 390, ACTION","364, 369, MODAL","200, 253, CONTENT","190, 196, ACTION","10, 22, LOCATION","167, 176, TRIGGER","28, 70, LOCATION","307, 343, CONTENT","632, 777, CONTENT","347, 359, LOCATION","390, 565, CONTENT"}
10381	Remark 7. Issues regarding the mathematical formalism. The author must improve the mathematical formalism and pay more attention to the details. For example, the author must explain what is the meaning  of the variables denoted by the letters gamma, lambda and omega (written in uppercase), in equations from lines 106-107, 111.	{"294, 327, LOCATION","182, 289, CONTENT","173, 201, ACTION","83, 105, CONTENT","71, 79, ACTION","66, 71, MODAL","169, 174, MODAL","182, 186, TRIGGER","174, 182, ACTION","110, 128, ACTION","129, 143, CONTENT","66, 70, MODAL","309, 322, LOCATION"}

In order to validate the usefulness of his research, when presenting its obtained results, the author should make a comparison between his study from the manuscript and other ones that have been developed and used in the literature for the same or similar purposes. The manuscript does not clearly reflect the way in which the developed approach and the obtained results can be perceived in perspective of previous studies that have tackled  similar problems.

10386	Ø  The sections of the manuscript in its actual form are not according to the ones recommended by the Sustainability MDPI Journal's Template. The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the above-mentioned template that provides a more logical structure that is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to better express the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review should be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5. Conclusions (not mandatory), 6. Patents (not mandatory), Supplementary Materials (not mandatory), Author Contributions, Funding, Acknowledgments, Conflicts of Interest, Appendices and References.	{"192, 205, ACTION","23, 33, LOCATION","595, 894, CONTENT","409, 527, CONTENT","571, 578, MODAL","581, 595, ACTION","170, 174, MODAL","269, 291, CONTENT","258, 267, ACTION","205, 252, CONTENT","83, 94, ACTION","170, 175, MODAL","146, 157, LOCATION","529, 541, TRIGGER","350, 381, CONTENT","392, 397, ACTION","382, 387, MODAL","3, 16, CONTENT","53, 70, ACTION","71, 140, CONTENT","183, 185, TRIGGER","175, 182, ACTION","23, 33, LOCATION"}

I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 12 (like the authors have did) or even more scientific works in a few lines just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section. In this section, the authors must introduce a presentation of the current state of the research field by reviewing it carefully and by citing key publications. By doing so, the problem will be put into context and it will benefit the readers as well. The purpose of the literature survey is to highlight exactly, for each of the involved referenced papers the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the method used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article. This is the only way to contextualize the current state of the art in which the authors of the manuscript position their paper and address aspects that have not been tackled/solved yet by the existing studies.	{"827, 834, ACTION","441, 577, CONTENT","585, 603, LOCATION","707, 763, CONTENT","404, 422, ACTION","431, 441, LOCATION","1266, 1436, CONTENT","1252, 1265, ACTION","1228, 1248, CONTENT","856, 1226, CONTENT","634, 638, MODAL","798, 815, ACTION","778, 789, CONTENT","790, 795, MODAL","651, 706, CONTENT","639, 649, ACTION","634, 639, MODAL","608, 620, LOCATION","45, 384, LOCATION","20, 42, LOCATION","3, 14, LOCATION","822, 827, MODAL","3, 14, LOCATION","679, 684, ACTION","211, 218, TRIGGER"}

10398	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: energies-685296, having the title "Artificial Learning Dispatch Planning with Probabilistic Forecasts: using Uncertainties as an Asset". In this paper, the authors present an energy dispatch optimization strategy that takes into consideration the probabilistic weather forecasts.

10401	The Main Weak Point:  A weak point consists in the structure of the manuscript. If the authors make an effort to improve the structure of the manuscript and complement it with the recommendations from the specific comments, the authors will arrive at an article that can bring  a valuable insight to the current state of knowledge.	{"236, 241, MODAL","68, 78, LOCATION","270, 276, ACTION","236, 240, MODAL","113, 121, ACTION","125, 152, CONTENT","157, 168, ACTION","171, 222, CONTENT","241, 248, ACTION","254, 330, CONTENT","68, 78, LOCATION","80, 82, TRIGGER","47, 60, CONTENT"}
10402	Comments regarding the sections of the manuscript. The sections of the manuscript in its actual form are not according to the ones recommended by the Energies MDPI Journal's Template. The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the above-mentioned template that provides a more logical structure that is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to better express the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review should be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5. Conclusions (not mandatory), 6. Patents (not mandatory), Supplementary Materials (not mandatory), Author Contributions, Funding, Acknowledgments, Conflicts of Interest, Appendices and References.	{"119, 182, CONTENT","188, 198, LOCATION","234, 247, ACTION","247, 294, CONTENT","300, 309, ACTION","311, 386, CONTENT","392, 423, CONTENT","424, 429, MODAL","461, 469, ACTION","613, 620, MODAL","623, 637, ACTION","637, 936, CONTENT","571, 583, TRIGGER","473, 569, CONTENT","39, 49, LOCATION","131, 142, ACTION","212, 216, MODAL","101, 118, ACTION","55, 81, CONTENT","212, 217, MODAL"}
10403	Lines 24-26, the "Abstract" of the paper. In the "Abstract" of the paper, along with the elements that have already been presented, the authors should briefly present the main obtained numerical results that empower them to state: "Results especially show that information included in probabilistic forecasts can increase financial revenues if  processed in a suitable way.".	{"17, 27, LOCATION","0, 11, LOCATION","49, 59, LOCATION","144, 151, MODAL","159, 167, ACTION","171, 202, CONTENT","231, 374, LOCATION","0, 11, LOCATION","121, 130, ACTION","144, 150, MODAL"}
10404	Lines 30-206, the "Introduction" section. In the "Introduction" section, the authors must introduce a presentation of the current state of the research field by reviewing it carefully and by citing key publications. By doing so, the problem will be put into context and it will benefit the readers as well. The purpose of the literature survey is to highlight for each of the involved referenced papers the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the method used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article. This is the only way to contextualize the current state of the art in which the authors of the manuscript position their paper and address aspects that have not been tackled/solved yet by the existing studies.	{"130, 135, ACTION","85, 89, MODAL","740, 745, TRIGGER","49, 71, LOCATION","229, 240, CONTENT","246, 252, ACTION","241, 246, MODAL","90, 100, ACTION","85, 90, MODAL","18, 40, LOCATION","6, 12, LOCATION","0, 12, LOCATION","708, 878, CONTENT","307, 668, CONTENT","670, 690, CONTENT","694, 708, ACTION","100, 214, CONTENT"}
10405	The "Introduction" section. In the "Introduction" section the authors must also declare the novel aspects of their work. After declaring the novel aspects of their work, at the end of the "Introduction" section, the authors should present the structure of their paper, under the form: "The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 contains…".	{"177, 210, LOCATION","243, 267, CONTENT","5, 17, LOCATION","224, 238, ACTION","70, 74, MODAL","92, 119, CONTENT","80, 88, ACTION","70, 75, MODAL","35, 57, LOCATION","4, 26, LOCATION","224, 231, MODAL","231, 239, ACTION","285, 354, CONTENT"}
10406	Comments regarding Figure 9. In section 3.2.3, the authors describe the steps that should be presented  in Figure 9. In this context, it will benefit the manuscript if the steps would be better highlighted  in Figure 9 by numbering them.	{"93, 104, ACTION","210, 218, LOCATION","134, 164, CONTENT","193, 205, ACTION","178, 184, MODAL","172, 178, CONTENT","107, 115, LOCATION","59, 77, CONTENT","83, 90, MODAL","32, 45, LOCATION","19, 27, LOCATION","19, 27, LOCATION","59, 67, ACTION","83, 89, MODAL","218, 236, CONTENT","165, 167, TRIGGER"}
10407	The "Materials and Methods" section. In order to bring a benefit to the manuscript, the authors should devise an appropriate "Materials and Methods" section in which to state and justify very clear, preferably within the first paragraph, the choices they have made when developing the final form of their proposed approach. The authors should state what has justified using  this approach, what is special, unexpected, or different in their research methodology. It will benefit if the authors mention if they have tried other approaches that in the end led them to the current form of their research design.	{"479, 481, TRIGGER","471, 478, ACTION","96, 103, MODAL","4, 35, LOCATION","72, 82, LOCATION","169, 174, ACTION","96, 102, MODAL","160, 165, TRIGGER","113, 156, CONTENT","169, 175, ACTION","179, 187, ACTION","221, 236, LOCATION","242, 322, CONTENT","336, 343, MODAL","343, 349, ACTION","349, 461, CONTENT","494, 502, ACTION","466, 470, MODAL","502, 608, CONTENT","103, 110, ACTION"}
10408	The "Materials and Methods" section. I consider that in the "Materials and Method" section, besides the above-mentioned details, the authors should specify the detailed hardware (CPU architecture, manufacturer, motherboard, RAM frequency, GPU, GPU memory…)  and software configurations (Operating System version, Drivers version, MATLAB version…) that they have used when developing their research, in order to provide all the necessary details for assuring the reproducibility of their study.	{"4, 35, LOCATION","60, 90, LOCATION","141, 148, MODAL","19, 25, LOCATION","110, 119, ACTION","367, 371, TRIGGER","148, 156, ACTION","92, 127, CONTENT","156, 492, CONTENT"}
10409	Lines 511-515: "Just as in [15], the optimization algorithm selected to be applied in combination with the proposed UPP was the rule-based heuristic optimizer developed in [14], as this algorithm is suitable for CSP plants and also goes along with ALFRED’s strategy, having fast computational time and intuitive application. The plant model used for the simulations is also described in [14]." The authors must provide more specific details regarding  the optimization algorithm and the plant model used for simulations, instead of asking the reader to document this important aspect on his own, risking in acquiring different information than the one intended by the authors.	{"60, 68, ACTION","0, 13, LOCATION","0, 13, LOCATION","15, 393, LOCATION","406, 411, MODAL","411, 419, ACTION","419, 519, CONTENT"}
10410	Lines 518-523, within the "Annual Simulations" section. The authors state " With data sets availability from May 2015 to May 2018, the two full years (2016 and 2017) were selected as testing periods, in which ALFRED is applied for the real operation simulation. The other months are then used for the UPP training. Although in a real application future data cannot be used  as learning support for present schedule planning (e.g. using 2018 data as training for 2017 operation), the setups used here aim to test ALFRED’s learning effectiveness for an entire year." I would like the authors to comment in the paper whether the data collected previously (between 2015 and 2018) are still relevant today, at the end of the year 2019, in what concerns the same problem. The authors should provide explanations whether their study is consistent, whether the changes that may occur within the older dataset from the above-mentioned period and the current year risk altering the final result. The authors must provide more details regarding the way in which they intend to solve the problems related to missing  data or abnormal values if they are to occur.	{"109, 112, MODAL","0, 13, LOCATION","26, 54, LOCATION","74, 564, LOCATION","567, 573, MODAL","593, 601, ACTION","608, 614, LOCATION","614, 764, CONTENT","778, 785, MODAL","785, 793, ACTION","793, 839, CONTENT","841, 984, CONTENT","998, 1003, MODAL","1003, 1011, ACTION","1011, 1149, CONTENT","0, 13, LOCATION","68, 73, ACTION","203, 208, TRIGGER"}
10411	Issues regarding the datasets and the source code. I consider that the exact datasets along with the source code that the authors have used when running the experimental tests will be a valuable addition to the article if they can be provided  as supplementary materials to the manuscript as the authors must provide all the necessary details in order to allow other researchers to verify, reproduce, discuss and extend the obtained published results of the authors.	{"140, 144, TRIGGER","247, 260, LOCATION","135, 139, ACTION","176, 180, MODAL","186, 218, CONTENT","71, 112, CONTENT","176, 181, MODAL","227, 231, MODAL","234, 244, ACTION","304, 309, MODAL","309, 317, ACTION","325, 450, CONTENT","247, 270, LOCATION","219, 222, TRIGGER","21, 49, CONTENT"}
10412	The "Discussion" section. In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Discussion" section (which is currently missing from the manuscript), the authors should make a comparison between their approach from the manuscript and other similar ones that have been developed in the literature for the same or related purposes. There are a lot of valuable studies in the scientific literature related to the subject of the manuscript to which the authors can compare to and this comparison will highlight even more the novel aspects that their paper brought in contrast to the existing   studies.	{"501, 505, MODAL","38, 79, CONTENT","88, 108, LOCATION","185, 337, CONTENT","178, 183, ACTION","171, 178, MODAL","4, 24, LOCATION","110, 115, TRIGGER","116, 136, ACTION","146, 156, LOCATION","339, 427, CONTENT","466, 469, MODAL","470, 477, ACTION","485, 500, CONTENT","506, 515, ACTION","515, 606, CONTENT","171, 177, MODAL","5, 15, LOCATION","129, 136, ACTION","110, 115, TRIGGER"}
10413	For example, as the authors have succeeded in establishing a precedence in their line of research, I consider that the manuscript under review will benefit a lot if the authors highlight in the "Discussion" section how their research has evolved from the findings of their previous studies, for example from the ones depicted in the cited paper [15], namely "A. C. do Amaral Burghi, T. Hirsch and R. Pitz-Paal, Artificial Learning Dispatch Planning for Flexible Renewable Energy Systems. Submitted to Energies."	{"143, 147, MODAL","119, 129, LOCATION","215, 218, TRIGGER","308, 349, CONTENT","214, 289, CONTENT","358, 511, LOCATION","162, 164, TRIGGER","194, 214, LOCATION","143, 148, MODAL","119, 129, LOCATION","177, 186, ACTION","351, 358, TRIGGER","148, 155, ACTION"}
10414	The authors should highlight clearly what are the main differences between the proposed approach from the Manuscript ID: energies-685296 and the approaches presented in the cited paper [15]. In this context, I would like the authors of the Manuscript ID: energies-685296 to highlight clearly, by writing in the "Discussion" section of the paper, what are the main differences between their conducted study and the other one, for example it would be interesting for the reader to know what are the differences between the current approach from the current manuscript and the one from the cited  paper [15].	{"210, 216, MODAL","106, 117, LOCATION","137, 189, CONTENT","37, 96, CONTENT","12, 19, MODAL","476, 605, CONTENT","449, 461, ACTION","440, 446, MODAL","19, 29, ACTION","346, 423, CONTENT","311, 331, LOCATION","274, 284, ACTION","12, 18, MODAL","106, 116, LOCATION","156, 165, ACTION","37, 41, TRIGGER"}
10415	However, due to the fact that the paper [15] is submitted to the MDPI Journal Energies and is under the review process, its status is still uncertain (being unpublished and not clear if and when is going to be published) and therefore, the reference [15], the corresponding citation and the above-mentioned comparison risks to become devoid of subject matter if the paper [15] is not published. Consequently, it will help to post the previous paper [15] on a preprint platform before referring and comparing to it in the current manuscript.	{"412, 416, MODAL","529, 539, LOCATION","297, 306, ACTION","190, 194, TRIGGER","422, 539, CONTENT","240, 254, LOCATION","34, 44, LOCATION","256, 393, CONTENT","0, 7, TRIGGER","225, 234, TRIGGER","412, 417, MODAL","417, 422, ACTION"}
10416	The "Discussion" section. In the "Discussion" section (which is currently missing from the manuscript), the authors should present the findings and their main implications, also highlighting current limitations of their study, and briefly mention some precise directions that they intend to follow in their future research work.	{"131, 225, CONTENT","4, 24, LOCATION","33, 53, LOCATION","116, 123, MODAL","123, 131, ACTION","247, 327, CONTENT","239, 247, ACTION","55, 60, TRIGGER","61, 81, ACTION","91, 101, LOCATION","74, 81, ACTION","5, 15, LOCATION","55, 60, TRIGGER"}
10417	The "Discussion" section. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their analysis and provide an insight at the end of the "Discussion" section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained results, the most important, appropriate and concrete actions that the decisional factors and all the involved parties should take in order to benefit from the results of the research conducted within the manuscript.	{"52, 56, MODAL","5, 15, LOCATION","195, 199, TRIGGER","4, 24, LOCATION","195, 458, CONTENT","65, 67, TRIGGER","57, 64, ACTION","52, 56, MODAL","80, 99, ACTION","101, 122, CONTENT","127, 135, ACTION","135, 145, CONTENT","153, 184, LOCATION"}
10418	Other issues. Lines 184-186: "Designed to be applied for a renewable energy system with storage, the ALFRED method presented in [15] financially optimizes the dispatch schedule for a day-ahead operation, considering weather and electricity price forecasts as input. …" The ALFRED acronym (as any other acronyms) should be explained  the first time when they appear in the manuscript.	{"312, 319, MODAL","322, 333, ACTION","337, 382, CONTENT","29, 268, LOCATION","14, 27, LOCATION","273, 311, CONTENT","348, 352, TRIGGER","14, 27, LOCATION","115, 124, ACTION","312, 318, MODAL"}
10419	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: sustainability-440201, with the title "Development of an Influent Forecasting Model for Wastewater Treatment Plants in North America". In this paper, the authors analyze the possibility for wastewater treatment plants to utilize an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model for daily influent flow forecasting. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors address within the manuscript the following  aspects:	{"282, 292, ACTION","20, 30, LOCATION","20, 31, LOCATION","73, 168, LOCATION","385, 389, MODAL","413, 421, ACTION","432, 443, LOCATION","447, 465, CONTENT","398, 400, TRIGGER","390, 397, ACTION"}
10420	Ø  The sections of the manuscript. In the actual form of the paper, its sections are not according to the ones recommended by the Sustainability MDPI Journal's Template. The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the above-mentioned template that provides a more logical structure that is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to express better the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review should be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5. Conclusions (not mandatory), 6. Patents (not mandatory), Supplementary Materials (not mandatory), Author Contributions, Funding, Acknowledgments, Conflicts of Interest, Appendices and References.	{"211, 213, TRIGGER","623, 923, CONTENT","106, 168, CONTENT","220, 233, ACTION","233, 280, CONTENT","609, 623, ACTION","7, 33, CONTENT","81, 98, ACTION","72, 81, CONTENT","198, 203, MODAL","378, 409, CONTENT","410, 415, MODAL","420, 425, ACTION","557, 569, TRIGGER","440, 555, CONTENT","599, 606, MODAL","203, 210, ACTION","23, 33, LOCATION","111, 122, ACTION","198, 202, MODAL"}
10421	Ø  Lines 10-19, the "Abstract" of the paper. In the "Abstract" of the paper, the authors must present in a clearer manner the following  aspects: the background, the methods, the main findings, the conclusions, as in the actual form of the manuscript, the abstract offers information related only to some of these aspects and even so, their delimitation is unclear. In the abstract the authors must also declare and briefly justify the novelty of their work.	{"89, 93, MODAL","3, 14, LOCATION","93, 135, ACTION","436, 457, CONTENT","424, 432, ACTION","404, 412, ACTION","394, 399, MODAL","373, 381, LOCATION","102, 209, CONTENT","94, 102, ACTION","89, 94, MODAL","52, 62, LOCATION","20, 30, LOCATION","3, 14, LOCATION"}
10422	Ø  Lines 22-79, the "Introduction" section. In this section, the authors must introduce a presentation of the current state of the research field by reviewing it carefully and by citing key publications. By doing so, the problem will be put into context and it will benefit the readers as well. In the actual form of the manuscript, the state of art regarding the paper's field of research is too short. I consider that the article under review will benefit if the authors extend this section by citing other publications from the multiple relevant ones that exist in the scientific literature regarding  the article's topic. After having performed a critical survey of what has been done up to this point in the scientific literature, the authors must identify a gap in the current state of knowledge that needs to be filled, a gap that is being addressed by their manuscript. This gap must also be used afterwards, in the "Discussion" section of the manuscript which is currently missing from the manuscript) as well, where the authors should justify why their approach fills the identified gap in rapport with previous studies from the literature. In the "Introduction" section the authors must also declare the novel aspects of their work. At the end of the Introduction section, the authors must present the structure of their paper under the form: "The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 contains…".	{"496, 624, CONTENT","389, 402, ACTION","321, 331, LOCATION","424, 444, CONTENT","445, 450, MODAL","473, 480, ACTION","480, 492, LOCATION","748, 753, MODAL","753, 762, ACTION","764, 877, CONTENT","887, 892, MODAL","900, 905, ACTION","878, 886, CONTENT","924, 944, LOCATION","1038, 1045, MODAL","1045, 1053, ACTION","1053, 1149, CONTENT","1158, 1180, LOCATION","1193, 1198, MODAL","1203, 1211, ACTION","1215, 1242, CONTENT","1251, 1282, LOCATION","1296, 1301, MODAL","1301, 1309, ACTION","1313, 1423, CONTENT","88, 202, CONTENT","963, 968, TRIGGER","969, 989, ACTION","998, 1009, LOCATION","3, 14, LOCATION","458, 460, TRIGGER","450, 457, ACTION","20, 42, LOCATION","47, 59, LOCATION","73, 78, MODAL","78, 88, ACTION","217, 228, CONTENT","229, 234, MODAL","234, 253, ACTION","261, 266, MODAL","266, 285, CONTENT","337, 389, CONTENT","73, 77, MODAL","3, 14, LOCATION","118, 123, ACTION","670, 674, TRIGGER"}
10423	Ø  Line 116, Figure 1. This Figure depicts the "Explanation of the three main steps introduced by Box and Jenkins in 1970". The figure is interesting, but it contains the steps previously developed by other authors in 1970, not by the authors of the paper under review. Therefore, in addition to this figure, in order to help the readers better understand the methodology of the conducted research, the authors should devise a flowchart within the "Materials and Methods" section, a flowchart that depicts the steps that they have processed in developing their research and most important of all, the final target. This flowchart will facilitate the understanding of the proposed approach and in the same time will make the article more interesting  to the readers if used as a graphical abstract.	{"411, 417, MODAL","3, 11, LOCATION","634, 748, ACTION","151, 154, TRIGGER","47, 122, LOCATION","724, 748, CONTENT","715, 720, ACTION","710, 715, MODAL","650, 688, CONTENT","635, 646, ACTION","3, 11, LOCATION","13, 21, LOCATION","630, 635, MODAL","615, 629, CONTENT","483, 613, CONTENT","448, 479, LOCATION","151, 154, TRIGGER","270, 279, TRIGGER","427, 436, CONTENT","418, 425, ACTION","411, 418, MODAL","773, 796, CONTENT","768, 773, ACTION","765, 768, TRIGGER"}

I consider that the authors should explain within the manuscript if the overall dataset provided for the 5 different stations is consistent in the context of the actual study, as they refer to different periods of time. Moreover, the information from Table 1 is incomplete, as a series of details regarding the Confidential Plant I and II are not available.

10434	The Main Weak Points. A weak point consists in the use of the English language. If the use of the English language is improved by means of a native speaker, I believe that the semantics of the paragraphs will come across clearer to the reader and the authors will arrive at an article that can bring  a valuable insight to the current state of knowledge. Due to the use of the English language, the paper is not completely clear, and due to the devised sections, it is not very well structured, being also difficult to follow and comprehend.	{"209, 228, ACTION","80, 83, TRIGGER","506, 540, CONTENT","434, 461, CONTENT","204, 209, MODAL","259, 264, MODAL","264, 271, ACTION","172, 203, CONTENT","277, 353, CONTENT","366, 393, CONTENT","405, 428, ACTION","399, 405, CONTENT","469, 493, ACTION","118, 126, ACTION","87, 114, CONTENT","51, 54, ACTION","204, 208, MODAL"}

The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the above-mentioned template that provides a more logical structure that is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to better express the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review should be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5.

10438	Remarks regarding the "Introduction" section. After having performed a critical survey of what has been done up to this point in the scientific literature, the authors must identify and state clearly a gap in the current state of knowledge that needs to be filled, a gap that is being addressed by their manuscript. This gap must also be used afterwards, in the "Discussion" section of the manuscript as well, where the authors should justify why their approach fills the identified gap in rapport with previous studies from the literature.

10439	Remarks regarding the "Materials and Methods" section. It will benefit the paper if the authors restructure their paper and devise a proper "Materials and methods" section (which is currently missing from the manuscript), in which the new developed methods are described in detail while well-established methods (and information) are briefly described and appropriately cited. In order to bring a benefit to the manuscript, the authors should state and justify very clear in the "Materials and Methods" section, preferably within the first paragraph, the choices they have made when developing the final form of their proposed approach. The authors should state what has justified using  this approach, what is special, unexpected, or different in their research methodology. It will benefit the paper if the authors mention if they have tried other approaches that in the end led them to the current form of their research design.	{"173, 178, TRIGGER","192, 199, ACTION","209, 219, LOCATION","58, 62, MODAL","784, 791, ACTION","173, 178, TRIGGER","179, 199, ACTION","209, 219, LOCATION","534, 549, LOCATION","453, 461, ACTION","479, 510, LOCATION","555, 635, CONTENT","649, 656, MODAL","656, 662, ACTION","662, 774, CONTENT","779, 784, MODAL","817, 825, ACTION","825, 828, TRIGGER","828, 931, CONTENT","795, 801, LOCATION","802, 804, TRIGGER","140, 171, LOCATION","22, 53, LOCATION","96, 108, ACTION","58, 63, MODAL","108, 119, CONTENT","124, 131, ACTION","235, 256, CONTENT","257, 270, ACTION","271, 280, CONTENT","281, 287, TRIGGER","287, 329, CONTENT","342, 352, ACTION","370, 375, ACTION","412, 422, LOCATION","436, 443, MODAL","443, 449, ACTION"}

In this section, the authors state: "Also, some of the common bus-networks with their respective characteristics and visual representation is described in Fig.3 to 5.". I do not contradict this information, but a citation is needed for the information contained within these figures. Moreover, this section contains a lot of uninterpreted and insufficiently explained tables and figures (Tables 1 and 2, along with Figures 3 to 5), spreading along pages 6 and 7. The authors must explain and analyze in detail all the tables and figures that have been inserted within the manuscript, it is not suitable to put the reader in the situation of interpreting, analyzing, continuing or refining the study from the manuscript under review.	{"21, 30, LOCATION","264, 267, TRIGGER","86, 91, ACTION","645, 659, ACTION","505, 518, LOCATION","532, 537, MODAL","21, 30, LOCATION","537, 545, ACTION","32, 55, LOCATION","60, 72, LOCATION","270, 278, CONTENT","279, 288, ACTION","296, 339, CONTENT","341, 349, TRIGGER","351, 363, LOCATION","364, 373, ACTION","549, 557, ACTION","567, 639, CONTENT","663, 755, CONTENT","765, 776, LOCATION","472, 486, LOCATION","445, 459, LOCATION","373, 444, CONTENT","264, 267, TRIGGER","93, 224, LOCATION"}
10444	Remarks regarding the "Simulation results and dicussion" section. First of all, the title of this section is misspelled, it is spelled "dicussion" instead of "discussion". Secondly, along with the elements already presented in this section (or in a separate "Discussion" section, as recommended by the Symmetry MDPI Journal's Template), the authors should also highlight current limitations of their study, and briefly mention some precise directions that they intend to follow in their future research work.	{"258, 278, LOCATION","106, 119, ACTION","84, 105, LOCATION","371, 405, CONTENT","21, 64, LOCATION","135, 146, LOCATION","158, 170, CONTENT","227, 239, LOCATION","349, 356, MODAL","361, 371, ACTION","419, 427, ACTION","432, 507, CONTENT","280, 334, CONTENT","147, 157, TRIGGER","84, 89, LOCATION","349, 355, MODAL","214, 223, ACTION"}

10453	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: environments-469747, with the title "The possibility of generating electricity using small-scale wind turbine and PV system for a household in Northern Cyprus: A comparative study". In this paper, the authors investigate the wind characteristics and available wind energy for three urban regions in Northern Cyprus using the Weibull distribution function. Afterwards, the authors analyze the solar potential of a photovoltaic system using three simulation software applications (PVGIS, PV*SOL, and PVWatts). I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors address within the manuscript the following  aspects:	{"391, 401, TRIGGER","20, 30, LOCATION","114, 119, ACTION","597, 605, ACTION","616, 627, LOCATION","631, 649, CONTENT","569, 574, MODAL","71, 215, LOCATION","20, 31, LOCATION","220, 230, LOCATION","574, 581, ACTION","582, 584, TRIGGER"}
10454	Ø  Lines 44-51, the "Introduction" section: "Wind and solar energy are important sources for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and consumption of fossil fuel [3,4]. In addition, wind and solar energy are clean, environmental friendly and inexhaustible energy source [5-7]. Alternative sources such as wind and solar are needed to reduce the GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions [7]. Wind and solar energy is the world’s fastest-growing energy source and it can power industry, businesses, and homes with clean, renewable electricity for many years to come [8,9]. Wind speed and Sunlight can be converted  directly into electricity using wind turbines [10] and solar photovoltaic (PV) [11], respectively. They are a considerable power source for meeting electricity demand in many countries [12]." I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 10 (like the authors have did) or even more scientific works in a few lines just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section. In this section, the authors must introduce a presentation of the current state of the research field by reviewing it carefully and by citing key publications. By doing so, the problem will be put into context and it will benefit the readers as well. The purpose of the literature survey is to highlight for each of the involved referenced papers the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the method used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article. This is the only way to contextualize the current state of the art in which the authors of the manuscript position their paper and address aspects that have not been tackled/solved yet by the existing studies.	{"1649, 1662, ACTION","1663, 1833, CONTENT","44, 790, LOCATION","1184, 1195, CONTENT","1196, 1200, MODAL","1204, 1220, ACTION","20, 42, LOCATION","3, 14, LOCATION","810, 828, ACTION","1055, 1169, CONTENT","1040, 1045, MODAL","1014, 1026, LOCATION","837, 848, LOCATION","848, 1009, CONTENT","1262, 1623, CONTENT","1625, 1645, CONTENT","1045, 1055, ACTION","1695, 1700, TRIGGER","3, 14, LOCATION","587, 597, ACTION","451, 454, MODAL"}
10455	Ø  Lines 80-81: I appreciate the fact that in the "Introduction" section, the authors have identified a gap in the current state of knowledge that is addressed by their manuscript and they state that other manuscripts of other authors did not tackle already. At the end of the Introduction, the authors must present the structure of their paper under the form: "The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 contains…".	{"123, 128, ACTION","3, 14, LOCATION","303, 308, MODAL","266, 289, LOCATION","50, 72, LOCATION","3, 14, LOCATION","320, 430, CONTENT","308, 316, ACTION"}
10456	Ø  The "Materials and Methods" section: In order to help the readers better understand the methodology of the conducted study, in the "Materials and Methods" section the authors should devise a flowchart that depicts the steps that they have processed in developing  their research and most important of all, the final target. This flowchart will facilitate the understanding  of the proposed approach.	{"192, 281, CONTENT","347, 358, ACTION","342, 347, MODAL","309, 325, CONTENT","134, 165, LOCATION","185, 192, ACTION","178, 185, MODAL","7, 38, LOCATION","327, 341, CONTENT","69, 125, CONTENT","362, 401, CONTENT","184, 265, ACTION"}
10457	Ø  The authors must improve the mathematical formalism and pay more attention to the details.  For example, the authors must explain what is the meaning  of "z10" that appears within the equations 5,6; regarding equation (15), for consistency reasons, in the case when vi is between vr and vco, one must correct the interval as being  left-open and right-close, otherwise the "vr" value is contained by both intervals considered in the first two cases, namely [vci, vr] and [vr, vco]; in the same equation, the third case could not contain the values vci and vco, as these two values have already been included by the first two cases of this equation. Please address these issues.	{"15, 19, MODAL","133, 137, TRIGGER","187, 198, LOCATION","124, 152, ACTION","304, 312, ACTION","544, 650, CONTENT","528, 539, ACTION","187, 200, LOCATION","157, 162, LOCATION","522, 528, MODAL","133, 152, CONTENT","507, 521, CONTENT","492, 505, LOCATION","460, 469, LOCATION","474, 483, LOCATION","453, 460, TRIGGER","316, 451, CONTENT","299, 304, MODAL","252, 293, CONTENT","212, 225, LOCATION","125, 133, ACTION","120, 125, MODAL","95, 106, TRIGGER","78, 92, CONTENT","59, 77, ACTION","32, 54, CONTENT","20, 28, ACTION","15, 20, MODAL","667, 679, CONTENT","659, 667, ACTION"}
10458	Ø  The datasets, Lines 98-100: "In the investigation of the wind energy potential and characteristics, three studied locations; namely, Lefko?a, Girne and Gazima?usa in Northern Cyprus, hourly wind speed data was collected from the Meteorology Department located in Lefko?a for various periods (2010-2016)." I would like the authors to provide more details regarding  the wind speed dataset. I would like the authors to comment in the paper whether the data collected previously (between 2010 and 2016) are still relevant today, in 2019, in what concerns the same problem. The authors should provide explanations whether their study is consistent, whether the changes that may occur within the older dataset from the above-mentioned period and the current year risk altering the final result. Lines 185-186: "In this study, the solar resource potentials at the selected towns in Northern Cyprus are taken from the radiation databases available from various software." I would like the authors to provide more details regarding  the databases from which they have retrieved the solar resource dataset, the period to which it corresponds, the amount of data. In both cases, the authors must provide more details regarding the way in which they have solved the problems related to missing  data or abnormal values if they are to occur.	{"585, 592, MODAL","441, 571, CONTENT","435, 441, LOCATION","420, 427, ACTION","394, 400, MODAL","648, 791, CONTENT","344, 390, CONTENT","336, 344, ACTION","310, 316, MODAL","31, 307, LOCATION","17, 29, LOCATION","600, 646, CONTENT","793, 806, LOCATION","808, 967, LOCATION","592, 600, ACTION","970, 976, MODAL","996, 1004, ACTION","1004, 1099, CONTENT","1184, 1189, MODAL","1101, 1135, CONTENT","1189, 1197, ACTION","1137, 1155, CONTENT","1197, 1332, CONTENT","315, 366, ACTION","17, 29, LOCATION","310, 315, MODAL","541, 545, TRIGGER"}
10459	Ø  The "Discussion" section: In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Discussion" section, the authors should make a comparison between their approach from the manuscript and other similar ones that have been developed in the literature for the same or related purposes. In the actual form of the manuscript, the "Discussion" section contains only one reference to other studies (and even this reference is not being used for comparing the results), so the comparison is missing in the manuscript's current form. There are a lot of valuable studies in the scientific literature related to the subject of the manuscript to which the authors can compare to and this comparison will highlight even more the novel aspects that their paper has brought in contrast to existing   studies. This comparison is mandatory in order to highlight the clear contribution to the current state of knowledge that the authors brought. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their analysis and provide an insight at the end of the "Discussion" section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained results, the most important, appropriate and concrete actions that the decisional factors and all the involved parties should take in order to benefit from the results of the research conducted within the manuscript.	{"125, 131, MODAL","8, 18, LOCATION","644, 649, TRIGGER","439, 443, ACTION","1249, 1273, CONTENT","722, 802, CONTENT","702, 712, ACTION","697, 702, MODAL","681, 696, CONTENT","490, 500, ACTION","479, 489, CONTENT","335, 355, LOCATION","139, 291, CONTENT","132, 137, ACTION","125, 132, MODAL","91, 111, LOCATION","29, 82, CONTENT","7, 27, LOCATION","1296, 1370, CONTENT","1281, 1295, ACTION","1274, 1281, MODAL","977, 979, TRIGGER","969, 976, ACTION","356, 384, CONTENT","803, 820, CONTENT","820, 832, ACTION","964, 968, MODAL","1117, 1244, CONTENT","1065, 1096, LOCATION","1050, 1057, CONTENT","1039, 1047, ACTION","1013, 1034, CONTENT","992, 1011, ACTION","845, 936, CONTENT"}
10460	Ø  The paper [20] from the "References" section has not been cited in the manuscript at all. Please address this issue either by citing this paper in the manuscript if it has been used in documenting the paper, or by deleting the reference in the opposite case.	{"168, 209, CONTENT","165, 168, TRIGGER","154, 165, LOCATION","100, 108, ACTION","74, 85, LOCATION","7, 17, CONTENT","48, 66, ACTION","108, 118, CONTENT","119, 126, TRIGGER","126, 146, CONTENT","211, 213, TRIGGER","27, 47, LOCATION","214, 260, CONTENT","74, 84, LOCATION","180, 184, ACTION"}
10461	Ø  The references are not cited in an ascending order (for example, after reference [34] comes reference [40], before references [35], [36], [37], [38] and [39]). Moreover, the reference [40] does not even exist in the References section. First of all, according to the MDPI Environments Journal's Template, the references must be numbered in the order of appearance in the text and listed  individually at the end of the manuscript. Secondly, the authors must either add in the References section the reference [40] or delete this citation from the manuscript if it has not been used in documenting the paper under review.	{"163, 171, TRIGGER","323, 327, MODAL","330, 389, ACTION","374, 378, LOCATION","456, 461, MODAL","468, 471, ACTION","3, 17, CONTENT","18, 31, ACTION","68, 89, LOCATION","95, 109, LOCATION","111, 160, LOCATION","173, 192, LOCATION","192, 211, ACTION","330, 339, ACTION","461, 467, TRIGGER","516, 519, TRIGGER","564, 622, CONTENT","561, 564, TRIGGER","527, 540, CONTENT","550, 561, LOCATION","520, 527, ACTION","479, 497, LOCATION","163, 171, TRIGGER","219, 237, LOCATION","312, 322, CONTENT","502, 516, CONTENT","323, 328, MODAL","340, 378, CONTENT","383, 391, ACTION","391, 403, CONTENT","411, 432, LOCATION","434, 442, TRIGGER"}
10462	Ø  The "Conclusions" section. I consider that along with the elements already presented in this section, the authors should interpret their findings at a higher level of abstraction than in the Discussion section. The authors should highlight whether, or to what extent they have managed to address the necessity identified within the Introduction section. The authors should avoid restating everything  they did once again, but instead they should emphasize what their findings actually mean to the readers, therefore making the Conclusions section interesting and memorable to them.	{"243, 312, CONTENT","233, 243, ACTION","124, 134, ACTION","134, 212, CONTENT","226, 233, MODAL","550, 583, CONTENT","530, 549, LOCATION","509, 519, TRIGGER","459, 507, CONTENT","449, 459, ACTION","442, 449, MODAL","382, 423, CONTENT","519, 529, CONTENT","425, 429, TRIGGER","376, 382, ACTION","369, 376, MODAL","7, 28, LOCATION","117, 124, MODAL","335, 355, LOCATION","78, 87, ACTION","258, 262, TRIGGER","117, 123, MODAL","194, 204, LOCATION"}
10463	Ø  Line 3, in the title of the manuscript: "…PV system…" Acronyms must be avoided  in the title, even if they are widely known.

10464	Ø  Line 181: "… metering systems, protection systems, etc." In a scientific paper one should avoid using  run-on expressions, such as "and so forth", "and so on" or "etc.". Therefore, instead of "etc.", the sentence should mention all the characteristics that have been into account in the study, as they are relevant to the analysis and to the obtained results.	{"223, 231, ACTION","216, 223, MODAL","173, 182, TRIGGER","99, 171, CONTENT","184, 194, TRIGGER","195, 201, LOCATION","93, 99, ACTION","86, 93, MODAL","13, 59, LOCATION","3, 11, LOCATION","231, 362, CONTENT","3, 11, LOCATION","92, 104, ACTION"}
10465	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: energies-380181, with the title "On Field Weakening Performance of a Brushless DC Motor With Higher Winding Inductance: Why Does Design Matter?". In this paper, the authors design, analyze, verify and evaluate the performance of a brushless DC (BLDC) motor using sub-fractional slot concentrated winding structure. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors address within the manuscript the following  aspects:	{"225, 231, ACTION","20, 30, LOCATION","66, 179, LOCATION","388, 391, TRIGGER","381, 388, ACTION","376, 380, MODAL","437, 457, CONTENT","370, 375, LOCATION","61, 66, LOCATION","423, 434, LOCATION","404, 412, ACTION","20, 31, LOCATION"}
10466	The sections of the manuscript in its actual form are not according to the ones recommended by the Energies MDPI Journal's Template. The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the above-mentioned template that provides a more logical structure, which is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to better express the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review must be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5.

This is the only way to contextualize the current state of the art in which the authors of the manuscript position their paper and address aspects that have not been tackled/solved yet by the existing studies.	{"3, 14, LOCATION","956, 960, MODAL","1611, 1616, TRIGGER","226, 231, ACTION","956, 961, MODAL","727, 745, ACTION","765, 899, CONTENT","1178, 1539, CONTENT","1541, 1562, CONTENT","1565, 1578, ACTION","907, 925, LOCATION","1579, 1749, CONTENT","3, 14, LOCATION","20, 42, LOCATION","44, 707, LOCATION","754, 765, LOCATION","930, 942, LOCATION","961, 971, ACTION","971, 1085, CONTENT","1100, 1111, CONTENT","1112, 1117, MODAL","1120, 1136, ACTION","1144, 1148, MODAL","1149, 1157, ACTION"}

I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their analysis and provide an insight at the end of the "Discussion" section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained results, the most important, appropriate and concrete actions that the decisional factors and all the involved parties should take in order to benefit from the results of the research conducted within the manuscript.	{"113, 118, TRIGGER","8, 18, LOCATION","132, 139, ACTION","174, 180, MODAL","469, 500, LOCATION","40, 82, CONTENT","7, 27, LOCATION","451, 462, CONTENT","443, 451, ACTION","417, 438, CONTENT","396, 415, ACTION","381, 383, TRIGGER","368, 373, MODAL","188, 340, CONTENT","699, 774, CONTENT","685, 698, ACTION","678, 684, MODAL","653, 678, CONTENT","373, 380, ACTION","149, 159, LOCATION","120, 139, ACTION","113, 118, TRIGGER","181, 186, ACTION","174, 181, MODAL","91, 111, LOCATION","511, 648, CONTENT"}

10494	The Main Strong Point. The manuscript under review approaches a very interesting topic for the experts in the field.	{"27, 38, LOCATION","27, 37, LOCATION"}
10495	The Main Weak Point. I consider that the main weak point consists in the structure of the manuscript. If the authors make an effort to improve the structure of the manuscript and complement it with the recommendations from the specific comments, the authors will arrive at an article that can bring  a valuable insight to the current state of knowledge.	{"90, 100, LOCATION","258, 262, MODAL","292, 298, ACTION","276, 352, CONTENT","147, 174, CONTENT","135, 143, ACTION","90, 100, LOCATION","73, 83, CONTENT","179, 190, ACTION","263, 270, ACTION","57, 66, ACTION","193, 244, CONTENT","41, 56, CONTENT","258, 263, MODAL"}

10497	Remark 1 - the sections of the manuscript. In the actual form of the paper, its sections are not according to the ones recommended by the Energies MDPI Journal's Template. The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the above-mentioned template that provides a more logical structure that is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to express better the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review should be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5. Conclusions (not mandatory), 6. Patents (not mandatory), Supplementary Materials (not mandatory), Author Contributions, Funding, Acknowledgments, Conflicts of Interest, Appendices and References.	{"31, 41, LOCATION","200, 204, MODAL","119, 130, ACTION","200, 205, MODAL","89, 106, ACTION","205, 212, ACTION","625, 925, CONTENT","380, 412, CONTENT","212, 215, TRIGGER","422, 427, ACTION","601, 608, MODAL","559, 571, TRIGGER","76, 88, CONTENT","412, 417, MODAL","110, 170, CONTENT","235, 282, CONTENT","439, 557, CONTENT","611, 625, ACTION","222, 235, ACTION"}
10498	Remark 2 - lines 9-19, the "Abstract" of the manuscript. In the "Abstract" of the paper, the authors must present in a clearer manner the following  aspects: the background, the methods, the main findings, the conclusions, as in the actual form of the manuscript, the abstract offers information related only to some of these aspects and even so, their delimitation is unclear. In the "Abstract" of the paper, along with the above-mentioned elements, the authors should briefly state the novelty of their proposed approach.	{"463, 470, MODAL","11, 21, LOCATION","27, 37, LOCATION","101, 106, MODAL","106, 114, ACTION","64, 74, LOCATION","353, 365, CONTENT","384, 395, LOCATION","478, 484, ACTION","488, 522, CONTENT","366, 376, ACTION","277, 333, CONTENT","268, 276, LOCATION","114, 221, CONTENT","11, 21, LOCATION","463, 469, MODAL","105, 147, ACTION"}
10499	Remark 3 - lines 43-46, the "Introduction" section. In its current form, the "Introduction" section contains 35 cited papers. I do not contradict the value of these papers, or their relevance in this context, but I consider that the article under review will benefit if the authors improve this section. The authors have presented the literature review of the cited papers in the following manner:  "Examples of mathematical approaches which were used to solve the UC problem are Lagrangian relaxation [6], branch and bound (combined with LR) [7], Bender’s decomposition [8], dynamic programming [9], mixed-integer programming [10], mixed-integer linear programming [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17], and stochastic programming [18]."	{"254, 258, MODAL","11, 22, LOCATION","209, 212, TRIGGER","321, 330, ACTION","399, 735, LOCATION","254, 259, MODAL","11, 22, LOCATION","282, 290, ACTION","208, 212, TRIGGER","259, 266, ACTION","109, 124, CONTENT","100, 108, ACTION","77, 99, LOCATION","28, 50, LOCATION","267, 269, TRIGGER","290, 302, CONTENT"}
10500	I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 12 (like the authors have did) scientific works in a few lines of text just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section. The literature review should be enhanced by performing a careful analysis of the cited  works. The purpose of the literature survey is to highlight exactly, for the involved referenced papers, the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the method used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article. This is the only way to contextualize the current state of the art in which the authors of the manuscript position their paper and address aspects that have not been tackled/solved yet by the existing studies.	{"310, 673, CONTENT","57, 187, CONTENT","46, 57, LOCATION","195, 213, LOCATION","219, 236, CONTENT","237, 244, MODAL","699, 712, ACTION","713, 883, CONTENT","247, 256, ACTION","256, 308, CONTENT","675, 695, CONTENT","19, 37, ACTION","246, 301, ACTION","46, 56, LOCATION","745, 750, TRIGGER","237, 243, MODAL"}
10501	Remark 4 - the gap in the scientific literature. After having performed a critical survey of what has been done up to this point in the scientific literature, the authors must identify and state more clearly in the paper a gap in the current state of knowledge that needs to be filled, a gap that is being addressed by their manuscript. This gap must also be used afterwards, in the "Discussion" section of the manuscript as well, where the authors should justify why their approach fills the identified gap in rapport with previous studies from the literature.	{"189, 194, ACTION","325, 335, LOCATION","93, 97, TRIGGER","171, 175, MODAL","359, 363, ACTION","411, 421, LOCATION","195, 335, CONTENT","15, 47, CONTENT","171, 176, MODAL","176, 185, ACTION","189, 195, ACTION","337, 345, CONTENT","346, 351, MODAL","364, 374, CONTENT","383, 403, LOCATION","449, 456, MODAL","456, 464, ACTION","464, 560, CONTENT"}
10502	Remark 5 - other issues regarding the "Introduction". In the "Introduction" section the authors must also declare the novel aspects of their work. After declaring the novel aspects of their work, at the end of the "Introduction" section, the authors should present the structure of their paper, under the form: "The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 contains…".	{"38, 52, LOCATION","61, 83, LOCATION","96, 101, MODAL","106, 114, ACTION","118, 145, CONTENT","202, 236, LOCATION","250, 257, MODAL","257, 265, ACTION","265, 380, CONTENT","250, 264, ACTION","96, 100, MODAL","39, 51, LOCATION"}
10503	Remark 6 - the "Materials and Methods" section. It will benefit the paper if the authors restructure their paper and devise a "Materials and methods" section (eventually structured in subsections), in which the new developed methods are described in detail while well-established methods (and information) are briefly described and appropriately cited. I consider that the authors must pay more attention to the appropriate citation of the methods and results that have been retrieved from the scientific literature. When the authors present the information in the "Materials and Methods" section, they must assume clearly their original contribution by specifying this fact and by highlighting the fact that starting from a certain point there are depicted the original and novel aspects of their research in contrast to the already existing  ones from the literature.	{"638, 650, LOCATION","237, 246, ACTION","201, 206, TRIGGER","51, 55, MODAL","51, 56, MODAL","89, 101, ACTION","101, 112, CONTENT","117, 124, ACTION","381, 386, MODAL","386, 404, ACTION","408, 515, CONTENT","608, 615, ACTION","603, 608, MODAL","615, 868, CONTENT","198, 351, CONTENT","159, 195, CONTENT","126, 157, LOCATION","74, 76, TRIGGER","56, 63, ACTION","565, 596, LOCATION","15, 46, LOCATION"}
10504	Remark 7 - the "Materials and Methods" section. When presenting the devised approach in this section, it will be extremely helpful to design and insert a flowchart depicting the main sequence of steps that one has to process in order to reproduce the results of the conducted  study. This flowchart should be analyzed in detail within the manuscript by specifying all the elements needed  for each and every step, in order for one to be able to reproduce and reach the final result of the study.	{"105, 110, MODAL","15, 46, LOCATION","133, 140, ACTION","145, 152, ACTION","152, 282, CONTENT","299, 306, MODAL","284, 298, CONTENT","309, 318, ACTION","318, 327, CONTENT","339, 350, LOCATION","350, 494, CONTENT","48, 52, TRIGGER","105, 109, MODAL","53, 63, ACTION","339, 349, LOCATION"}
10505	Remark 8 - the equations within the manuscript. All the equations within the manuscript should be explained , demonstrated or cited, as there are some equations that have not been introduced in the literature for the first time by the authors and that are not cited.	{"97, 107, ACTION","88, 94, MODAL","36, 46, LOCATION","110, 123, ACTION","146, 160, CONTENT","123, 125, TRIGGER","15, 24, CONTENT","252, 265, ACTION","126, 131, ACTION","36, 46, LOCATION","48, 65, CONTENT","88, 95, MODAL","192, 242, CONTENT","98, 108, ACTION","166, 190, ACTION","77, 88, LOCATION"}
10506	Remark 9 - the datasets used. At Lines 125-126, the authors state: " The data of PV is taken from the NASA-Surface meteorology and Solar Energy service (NASA-SSE) [36]." First of all, I would like the authors to provide more details regarding  the used datasets. In order to be able to verify the relevance and correctness of the developed model, in the supplementary materials the authors must provide all the necessary details in order to allow other researchers to verify, reproduce, discuss and extend the obtained scientific results based on the obtained published results. Other researchers should not have to obtain and concatenate the datasets from various sources, risking in acquiring different datasets or datasets that have been normalized differently than the datasets on which the authors have performed their experimental tests and validations. The exact datasets that the authors have used will be a valuable addition to the manuscript if they can be provided  as supplementary materials to the manuscript as the authors must provide all the necessary details in order to allow other researchers to verify, reproduce, discuss and extend the obtained published results of the authors.	{"952, 955, TRIGGER","33, 46, LOCATION","860, 905, CONTENT","911, 933, ACTION","1037, 1042, MODAL","186, 192, MODAL","15, 28, CONTENT","354, 377, LOCATION","390, 395, MODAL","220, 261, CONTENT","395, 403, ACTION","906, 911, MODAL","941, 952, LOCATION","212, 220, ACTION","403, 577, CONTENT","1050, 1198, CONTENT","1042, 1050, ACTION","980, 1003, LOCATION","960, 964, MODAL","967, 977, ACTION","67, 169, LOCATION","390, 394, MODAL","785, 790, TRIGGER","33, 46, LOCATION","24, 28, ACTION"}
10507	Secondly, all data must be anchored  in time by specifying the time intervals to which the data refer to, otherwise the whole study risks to become inconsistent and irrelevant.	{"81, 86, TRIGGER","26, 35, ACTION","19, 23, MODAL","37, 104, CONTENT","19, 24, MODAL","106, 116, TRIGGER","116, 175, CONTENT","27, 37, ACTION","10, 18, CONTENT"}
10508	Thirdly, the authors must provide more details regarding the preprocessing approach that they have used and the way in which they intend to solve the problems related to missing  data or abnormal values if they are to occur.	{"34, 223, CONTENT","26, 34, ACTION","21, 26, MODAL","25, 177, ACTION","119, 124, TRIGGER"}
10509	Remark 10 - the "Discussion" section. In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Discussion" section (which is currently missing from the manuscript), the authors should make a comparison between their study from the manuscript and other ones that have been developed and used in the literature for the same or similar purposes. There are a lot of valuable studies in the scientific literature related to the subject of the manuscript to which the authors can compare to and this comparison will highlight even more the insights that their paper has brought in contrast to the existing   studies. This comparison is mandatory in order to highlight the clear contribution to the current state of knowledge that the authors have brought.	{"122, 127, TRIGGER","17, 27, LOCATION","141, 148, ACTION","183, 189, MODAL","516, 526, ACTION","646, 754, CONTENT","633, 645, ACTION","617, 632, CONTENT","350, 436, CONTENT","158, 168, LOCATION","128, 148, ACTION","122, 127, TRIGGER","526, 615, CONTENT","495, 510, CONTENT","480, 488, ACTION","476, 480, MODAL","511, 516, MODAL","197, 347, CONTENT","190, 195, ACTION","183, 190, MODAL","63, 91, CONTENT","50, 59, ACTION","100, 120, LOCATION","16, 36, LOCATION"}
10510	Remark 11 - the "Discussion" section.

10511	Remark 12 - the "Discussion " section. The paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their approach and provide an insight at the end of the "Discussion" section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained results, the most important benefits of the research conducted within the manuscript, taking also into account its practical applicability.	{"17, 27, LOCATION","192, 196, TRIGGER","49, 53, MODAL","16, 37, LOCATION","49, 54, MODAL","62, 65, TRIGGER","77, 96, ACTION","98, 119, CONTENT","132, 143, CONTENT","124, 132, ACTION","150, 181, LOCATION","192, 197, TRIGGER","197, 302, CONTENT","314, 324, LOCATION","326, 378, CONTENT","54, 61, ACTION"}
10512	Remark 13 - the "Discussion" section. The authors should highlight whether, or to what extent they have managed to address the necessity identified within the "Introduction" section.

10513	Remark 14 - the "Discussion" section. The scientific value of the "Discussion" section and of the manuscript under review will be considerably increased if the authors provide an insight regarding the feasibility of implementing their proposed  approach in a real production environment, taking also into consideration the associated costs for the necessary software and hardware equipment.	{"17, 27, LOCATION","129, 243, ACTION","122, 126, MODAL","16, 36, LOCATION","153, 155, TRIGGER","143, 153, ACTION","66, 86, LOCATION","42, 58, CONTENT","98, 109, LOCATION","122, 127, MODAL","168, 176, ACTION","176, 389, CONTENT"}
10514	Remark 15 - The tables and figures from the paper. In its actual form, the paper contains a lot of insufficiently interpreted and explained tables and figures. The authors must explain and analyze in detail all the tables and figures that have been inserted within the manuscript, it is not suitable to put the reader in the situation of interpreting, analyzing, continuing or refining the study from the manuscript under review.	{"81, 90, ACTION","92, 158, CONTENT","197, 257, CONTENT","269, 279, LOCATION","75, 80, LOCATION","189, 197, ACTION","172, 177, MODAL","177, 185, ACTION","16, 22, LOCATION","130, 139, ACTION"}

10516	Lines 53-55: "Hybrid of algorithms were also developed to improve the weakness either due to long computational time, near optimality, trapped in local optima, slow convergence, etc. [28]." In a scientific paper one should avoid using  run-on expressions, such as "and so forth", "and so on" or "etc.". Therefore, instead of "etc", the sentence should mention all the elements that are relevant to the analysis and to the obtained results in order to obtain a consistent, relevant and reproductible study.	{"280, 291, LOCATION","0, 11, LOCATION","264, 278, LOCATION","13, 189, LOCATION","325, 330, LOCATION","216, 223, MODAL","352, 360, ACTION","303, 312, TRIGGER","360, 504, CONTENT","229, 254, CONTENT","223, 228, ACTION","314, 324, TRIGGER","345, 352, MODAL","295, 301, LOCATION","0, 11, LOCATION","222, 234, ACTION"}
10517	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: sensors-736802, with the title "Real-Time Prediction of Rheological Properties of Invert Emulsion Mud Using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System". In this paper, the authors analyze the possibility to fully automate the process of retrieving rheological properties with high accuracy and in real-time for invert emulsion mud system based on the high-frequency measurements of mud density and Marsh funnel viscosity, using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors address within the manuscript the following  aspects:	{"20, 30, LOCATION","137, 142, ACTION","519, 525, LOCATION","588, 606, CONTENT","539, 542, TRIGGER","573, 584, LOCATION","531, 539, ACTION","554, 562, ACTION","526, 531, MODAL","20, 31, LOCATION","66, 181, LOCATION"}

10519	The Main Weak Points. I consider that the authors must assume more clearly in the manuscript their original contribution by specifying this fact and by highlighting the fact that starting  from a certain point there are presented the original and novel aspects of their research. The authors must state more clearly their original methods, their original results and conclusions, the novelty of their study. In the current form of the paper, this aspect is unclear. Another weak point consists in the structure of the manuscript. If the authors make an effort to improve the structure of the manuscript and complement it with the recommendations from the specific comments, the authors will arrive at an article that can bring  a valuable insight to the current state of knowledge. Due to the devised sections, the paper is not well structured, being also difficult to follow and comprehend.	{"82, 92, LOCATION","686, 690, MODAL","54, 187, ACTION","782, 788, TRIGGER","845, 890, ACTION","55, 62, ACTION","815, 820, LOCATION","821, 843, ACTION","454, 464, ACTION","50, 55, MODAL","442, 454, CONTENT","93, 278, CONTENT","82, 93, LOCATION","292, 297, MODAL","297, 303, ACTION","303, 406, CONTENT","501, 528, CONTENT","530, 533, TRIGGER","563, 571, ACTION","575, 602, CONTENT","607, 618, ACTION","621, 672, CONTENT","686, 691, MODAL","62, 74, CONTENT","691, 698, ACTION","698, 780, CONTENT"}

10521	Remarks regarding the sections of the manuscript. The sections of the manuscript in its actual form are not according to the ones recommended by the Sensors MDPI Journal's Template. Therefore, the manuscript under review will benefit if it is  restructured as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5.

10522	Remarks regarding the Abstract of the paper, lines 9-35. According to the recommendations from the Sensors MDPI Journal website regarding the format of the papers, "The abstract should be a single paragraph and should follow the style of structured  abstracts, but without headings." Moreover, taking into consideration that this is a research article, the abstract should offer a relevant overview of the work. It will benefit the paper if the authors provide a structured abstract, that covers the following aspects: the background (in which the authors should place the issue that the manuscript addresses in a broad context and highlight the purpose of the study), the methods used to solve the identified issue (that should be briefly described ), a summary of the article's main findings followed by the main conclusions or interpretations. In the abstract, the authors must also declare and briefly justify the novelty of their work. In the actual form of the manuscript, the abstract offers information related only to some of these aspects and even so, their delimitation is unclear.	{"876, 881, MODAL","1062, 1080, CONTENT","917, 939, CONTENT","854, 862, LOCATION","906, 914, ACTION","886, 894, ACTION","463, 845, CONTENT","453, 461, ACTION","415, 420, MODAL","381, 410, CONTENT","373, 379, ACTION","366, 373, MODAL","284, 292, TRIGGER","22, 30, LOCATION","45, 55, LOCATION","57, 283, CONTENT","357, 366, LOCATION","1081, 1091, ACTION","437, 440, TRIGGER","432, 437, LOCATION","420, 427, ACTION","983, 992, LOCATION","22, 30, LOCATION","261, 264, TRIGGER","178, 184, MODAL","187, 248, ACTION"}
10523	At Line 31, in the Abstract of the manuscript, the authors have stated that they have used as a metric the "average absolute percentage error (AAPE)". First of all, the authors must specify if there is any difference between this measure of prediction accuracy and the widely used Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). If they are the same, why use a different name and acronym? Secondly, according to the scientific literature, the AAPE acronym has a certain meaning, it stands for Arctangent Absolute Percentage Error [Sungil Kim, Heeyoung Kim, A new metric of absolute percentage error for intermittent demand forecasts, International Journal of Forecasting, Volume 32, Issue 3, 2016, Pages 669-679, ISSN 0169-2070, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207016000121 , accessed on 22 February 2020] while the authors of the Manuscript ID: sensors-736802 did not use this metric. Please reconsider and revise these aspects.	{"3, 10, LOCATION","64, 70, ACTION","341, 346, TRIGGER","346, 378, CONTENT","190, 318, CONTENT","907, 918, ACTION","922, 929, ACTION","324, 340, CONTENT","19, 27, LOCATION","3, 10, LOCATION","434, 819, CONTENT","929, 942, CONTENT","320, 322, TRIGGER","107, 149, LOCATION","177, 182, MODAL","182, 190, ACTION"}
10524	Remarks regarding the "Introduction" section, lines 99-105. "Lim and Kim [22] used the fuzzy logic technique to estimate the reservoir porosity and permeability from well logs. Additional AI tools were used to predict the rock petrophysical properties [23-25]. Elkatatny et al, [26] studied the sonic travel time prediction from the well log data. In drilling engineering, many studies were performed to apply AI science to predict the rate of penetration based on the parameters that affect the drilling performance [27-29]. The prediction of the rock geomechanical properties was studied to predict the rock geomechanics from the well log and 104 drilling data [30-37]." I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 16 (like the authors did) or even more scientific works in a few lines just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section. The same situation can be encountered afterwards, at Lines 119-129, where there are cited 9 papers within 11 lines of text. In the "Introduction" section, the authors must introduce a presentation of the current state of the research field by reviewing it carefully and by citing key publications. By doing so, the problem will be put into context and it will benefit the readers as well. The purpose of the literature survey is to highlight for each of the involved referenced papers the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the method used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article. This is the only way to contextualize the current state of the art in which the authors of the manuscript under review position their paper and address aspects that have not been tackled/solved yet by the existing studies.	{"1211, 1216, MODAL","941, 954, LOCATION","1060, 1070, ACTION","1055, 1060, MODAL","1019, 1041, LOCATION","60, 672, LOCATION","46, 58, LOCATION","1219, 1235, ACTION","22, 44, LOCATION","1243, 1248, MODAL","1281, 1313, CONTENT","1320, 1330, ACTION","1334, 1638, CONTENT","1664, 1678, ACTION","1640, 1660, CONTENT","691, 710, ACTION","711, 860, CONTENT","868, 886, LOCATION","1070, 1184, CONTENT","1678, 1861, CONTENT","1248, 1255, ACTION","1199, 1210, CONTENT","78, 82, ACTION","23, 35, LOCATION","907, 910, MODAL","926, 936, TRIGGER"}
10525	After having performed a critical survey of what has been done up to this point in the scientific literature, the authors must identify a gap in the current state of knowledge that needs to be filled, a gap that is being addressed by their manuscript. This gap must also be used afterwards, in the "Discussion" section of the manuscript (that currently does not exist) as well, where the authors should justify why their approach fills the identified gap in rapport with previous studies from the literature. In the "Introduction" section the authors must also declare the novel aspects of their work. At the end of the Introduction section, the authors must present the structure of their paper under the form: "The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 contains…".	{"240, 250, LOCATION","44, 48, TRIGGER","122, 126, MODAL","157, 162, ACTION","609, 640, LOCATION","353, 367, ACTION","136, 250, CONTENT","122, 127, MODAL","127, 136, ACTION","261, 266, MODAL","252, 260, CONTENT","274, 278, ACTION","279, 289, CONTENT","298, 318, LOCATION","396, 403, MODAL","403, 411, ACTION","411, 507, CONTENT","515, 538, LOCATION","551, 556, MODAL","561, 569, ACTION","573, 600, CONTENT","654, 659, MODAL","659, 667, ACTION","671, 781, CONTENT"}
10526	The "Materials and Methods" section is missing. It will benefit the paper if the authors restructure their paper and devise a proper "Materials and methods" section (which is currently missing from the manuscript), in which the new developed methods are described in detail while well-established methods (and information) are briefly described and appropriately cited. In order to bring a benefit to the manuscript, the authors should state and justify very clear in the "Materials and Methods" section, preferably within the first paragraph, the choices they have made when developing the final form of their proposed approach. The authors should state what has justified using  this approach, what is special, unexpected, or different in their research methodology. It will benefit the paper if the authors mention if they have tried other approaches that in the end led them to the current form of their research design.	{"795, 798, TRIGGER","74, 76, TRIGGER","777, 784, ACTION","202, 212, LOCATION","172, 193, ACTION","166, 171, TRIGGER","133, 164, LOCATION","68, 73, LOCATION","56, 63, ACTION","4, 35, LOCATION","36, 46, ACTION","51, 56, MODAL","89, 101, ACTION","117, 124, ACTION","101, 112, CONTENT","228, 249, CONTENT","254, 263, ACTION","264, 273, CONTENT","274, 279, TRIGGER","280, 322, CONTENT","335, 345, ACTION","349, 363, CONTENT","363, 368, ACTION","429, 436, MODAL","436, 442, ACTION","446, 454, ACTION","472, 503, LOCATION","516, 542, LOCATION","548, 628, CONTENT","642, 649, MODAL","649, 655, ACTION","818, 923, CONTENT","655, 767, CONTENT","789, 794, LOCATION","772, 777, MODAL","810, 818, ACTION","51, 55, MODAL","39, 46, ACTION","202, 212, LOCATION","166, 171, TRIGGER"}
10527	In order to help the readers better understand the methodology of the conducted study, in the "Materials and Methods" section the authors should devise a flowchart that depicts the steps that they have processed in developing  their research and most important of all, the final target. This flowchart will facilitate the understanding of the proposed approach and in the same time will make the article more interesting  to the readers if used as a graphical abstract. It will benefit the paper to specify, in the final part of the "Materials and Methods" section, details regarding the version numbers for the software and the detailed hardware configuration used within the research.	{"460, 468, LOCATION","302, 306, MODAL","144, 225, ACTION","499, 506, ACTION","94, 125, LOCATION","138, 145, MODAL","145, 152, ACTION","152, 285, CONTENT","287, 301, CONTENT","302, 307, MODAL","307, 318, ACTION","322, 360, CONTENT","382, 387, MODAL","387, 392, ACTION","396, 468, CONTENT","473, 478, MODAL","515, 564, LOCATION","566, 685, CONTENT"}
10528	Remarks regarding the "Discussion" section. In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Discussion" section (which is currently missing from the manuscript), the authors should make a comparison between their approach from the manuscript and other similar ones that have been developed and used in the literature for the same or related purposes. There are a lot of valuable studies in the scientific literature related to the subject of the manuscript to which the authors can compare to and this comparison will highlight even more the novel aspects that their paper has brought in contrast to the existing   studies.	{"557, 637, CONTENT","69, 97, CONTENT","106, 126, LOCATION","189, 196, MODAL","196, 201, ACTION","203, 364, CONTENT","512, 527, CONTENT","528, 533, MODAL","533, 543, ACTION","366, 453, CONTENT","164, 174, LOCATION","134, 154, ACTION","128, 133, TRIGGER","497, 504, ACTION","493, 496, MODAL","22, 42, LOCATION","56, 65, ACTION","23, 33, LOCATION","128, 133, TRIGGER","189, 195, MODAL","147, 154, ACTION"}
10529	The authors should present the findings and their main implications in the "Discussion" section, also highlighting current limitations of their study, and briefly mention some precise directions that they intend to follow in their future research work.	{"12, 26, ACTION","76, 86, LOCATION","12, 19, MODAL","19, 27, ACTION","31, 67, CONTENT","75, 95, LOCATION","171, 251, CONTENT","163, 171, ACTION","102, 115, ACTION","115, 149, CONTENT"}
10530	I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their analysis and provide an insight at the end of the "Discussion" section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained results, the most important, appropriate and concrete actions that the decisional factors and all the involved parties should take in order to benefit from the results of the research conducted within the manuscript.	{"101, 109, ACTION","311, 335, CONTENT","159, 306, CONTENT","38, 41, TRIGGER","31, 38, ACTION","26, 31, MODAL","54, 73, ACTION","75, 96, CONTENT","109, 119, CONTENT","127, 158, LOCATION","422, 432, LOCATION","336, 343, MODAL","343, 348, ACTION","348, 410, CONTENT","139, 149, LOCATION","169, 173, TRIGGER","26, 30, MODAL"}
10531	Remarks regarding the datasets. In what concerns the datasets, the authors state in section 2, at Lines 152-153: "The data was collected from real field measurements performed by mud engineers on the rig sites of 99 wells." and afterwards, at Lines 178-179: "Real field mud samples were used in this study after preprocessing from the outliers, invalid wrong readings, and repetitions to be 741 points that were used to build the AI model."	{"75, 80, ACTION","35, 39, TRIGGER","84, 93, LOCATION","258, 440, LOCATION","84, 93, LOCATION","98, 111, LOCATION","243, 256, LOCATION","113, 223, LOCATION"}
10532	First of all, all data must be anchored  in time by specifying the time intervals to which the data refer to, otherwise the whole study risks to become inconsistent and irrelevant.	{"110, 120, TRIGGER","23, 28, MODAL","42, 108, CONTENT","18, 23, CONTENT","31, 41, ACTION","124, 179, CONTENT","23, 27, MODAL","30, 39, ACTION","85, 90, TRIGGER"}
10533	Secondly, the authors must provide more details regarding the preprocessing approach that they have used and the way in which they intend to solve the problems related to missing  data or abnormal values if they are to occur.	{"120, 125, TRIGGER","26, 178, ACTION","22, 27, MODAL","35, 224, CONTENT","27, 35, ACTION"}
10534	Thirdly, the authors should provide more details regarding  the datasets that will be a valuable addition to the article if they are provided  as supplementary materials to the manuscript, taking into account the fact that the "Materials and Methods" section must provide all the necessary details as to allow other researchers to verify, reproduce, discuss and extend the obtained scientific results based on the obtained published results.	{"264, 272, ACTION","36, 187, CONTENT","227, 258, LOCATION","272, 440, CONTENT","21, 28, MODAL","259, 264, MODAL","28, 36, ACTION","27, 58, ACTION","78, 82, MODAL","146, 159, LOCATION"}
10535	Regarding the dataset, I consider that the authors should explain in the paper and justify if the "741 points that were used to build the AI model" (as stated at Line 179) constitute a representative sample for the modeled problem. Can the authors mention how much of their model is being  influenced by the used data or to which extent the model can be easily applied  to other situations, when the datasets are different? In this way, the authors could highlight more the generalization capability of their approach in order to be able to justify a wider contribution that has been brought to the current state of art.	{"256, 259, TRIGGER","162, 170, LOCATION","51, 65, ACTION","347, 350, MODAL","91, 94, TRIGGER","264, 422, CONTENT","162, 170, LOCATION","465, 619, CONTENT","83, 91, ACTION","172, 230, CONTENT","449, 455, MODAL","455, 465, ACTION","232, 236, MODAL","248, 256, ACTION","14, 21, CONTENT","58, 66, ACTION","256, 264, TRIGGER","51, 58, MODAL","98, 147, LOCATION","73, 78, LOCATION"}
10536	Lines 143-145: "The target of this study was to build an initial Sugeno-type FIS using subtractive clustering technique to be used in ANFIS training of the data set. ANFIS is an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) which is a type of artificial neural network (ANN)…"As the authors have used an Artificial Neural Network approach, I consider that the authors must specify how often does the network need to be retrained/updated and how did the authors tackle the need of retraining/updating the network. How is the data encountered stored for subsequent updates of the network?	{"517, 585, CONTENT","513, 516, TRIGGER","381, 511, CONTENT","373, 381, ACTION","368, 373, MODAL","15, 276, LOCATION","0, 13, LOCATION","81, 86, ACTION","224, 229, TRIGGER","0, 13, LOCATION"}
10537	Remark regarding the training algorithms. It will benefit the paper if the authors extend their paper by providing more details regarding the training algorithms that they have used when developing  their Artificial Neural Network approach.	{"182, 186, TRIGGER","49, 197, ACTION","50, 58, ACTION","68, 70, TRIGGER","83, 90, ACTION","20, 40, CONTENT","45, 50, MODAL","90, 239, CONTENT","62, 67, LOCATION"}
10538	Remarks regarding the "Conclusions" section. I consider that the results are insufficiently explained and interpreted by the current form of the "Conclusions" section. It will benefit the manuscript if the authors devise a proper "Conclusions" section in which they state the most important outcome of their work. The authors should avoid simply summarizing  the aspects that they have already stated in the body of the manuscript. Instead, they should interpret their findings at a higher level of abstraction than in the Discussion section. The authors should highlight whether, or to what extent they have managed to address the necessity, the gap identified within the "Introduction" section. The authors should avoid restating everything  they did once again, but instead they should emphasize what their findings actually mean to the readers, therefore making the Conclusions section interesting and memorable to them.	{"859, 865, CONTENT","408, 430, LOCATION","72, 117, ACTION","176, 184, ACTION","339, 400, CONTENT","463, 510, CONTENT","523, 541, LOCATION","555, 562, MODAL","870, 889, LOCATION","562, 572, ACTION","572, 641, CONTENT","673, 695, LOCATION","709, 716, MODAL","716, 722, ACTION","199, 201, TRIGGER","722, 763, CONTENT","765, 769, TRIGGER","782, 789, MODAL","789, 799, ACTION","333, 339, ACTION","326, 333, MODAL","221, 312, CONTENT","453, 463, ACTION","446, 453, MODAL","214, 221, ACTION","171, 176, MODAL","188, 199, LOCATION","145, 166, LOCATION","799, 847, CONTENT","61, 72, CONTENT","22, 43, LOCATION","890, 915, CONTENT","849, 859, TRIGGER","171, 175, MODAL","255, 260, TRIGGER","188, 198, LOCATION","92, 101, ACTION"}
10539	Remarks regarding the citations. In the actual version of the manuscript, the "References" section contains a paper that has not been cited in the manuscript at all, namely for the reference [50], I could not find any citation in the text of the Manuscript ID: sensors-736802, under the form required by the Sensors MDPI Journal's Template. The authors must address this issue by citing in the paper only the references that have been used and by deleting  the ones that are not useful in the context of the manuscript. At the Line 133, the authors have cited the reference [450], which does not exist, as the "References" section contains a list of 57 papers.	{"581, 586, TRIGGER","62, 72, LOCATION","199, 204, MODAL","357, 455, ACTION","353, 358, MODAL","358, 366, ACTION","147, 158, LOCATION","366, 376, CONTENT","394, 400, LOCATION","527, 535, LOCATION","554, 560, ACTION","564, 601, CONTENT","246, 257, LOCATION","610, 630, LOCATION","78, 98, LOCATION","121, 139, ACTION","22, 31, CONTENT","180, 195, LOCATION","199, 208, MODAL","208, 213, ACTION","214, 226, CONTENT","233, 239, LOCATION","377, 387, CONTENT","400, 518, CONTENT","630, 659, CONTENT","110, 116, CONTENT","166, 173, TRIGGER"}
10540	Remarks regarding the format of the paper. In addition to the above-mentioned issues, the authors must perform a thorough editing  of their manuscript in order to achieve a proper readable paper. The authors must take into account the recommendations from the Sensors MDPI Journal website regarding  the format of the papers ( https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/instructions ), by using the Microsoft Word template or LaTeX template to prepare their manuscript. In the actual form of the paper, most of these recommendations have not been taken into account. Therefore, the reading of the manuscript is affected. Please correct this aspect according to the Journal's Template.	{"213, 230, ACTION","630, 677, CONTENT","561, 570, TRIGGER","622, 630, ACTION","497, 526, CONTENT","527, 559, ACTION","113, 194, CONTENT","22, 41, CONTENT","98, 103, MODAL","103, 111, ACTION","208, 213, MODAL","235, 462, CONTENT","68, 77, ACTION","140, 150, LOCATION"}
10541	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: sustainability-656530, with the title "Ranking the policy alternatives for the sustainable economic growth with IT2F QUALIFEX method using forecasted carbon dioxide emission trends".

10543	Remarks regarding the sections of the manuscript. In the actual form of the paper, a part of its sections is not according to the ones recommended by the template of the MDPI Sustainability Journal. The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the above-mentioned template that provides a more logical structure that is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to express better the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review should be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5. Conclusions (not mandatory), 6. Patents (not mandatory), Supplementary Materials (not mandatory), Author Contributions, Funding, Acknowledgments, Conflicts of Interest, Appendices and References.	{"227, 231, MODAL","135, 146, ACTION","38, 48, LOCATION","652, 952, CONTENT","449, 454, ACTION","232, 239, ACTION","638, 652, ACTION","628, 635, MODAL","439, 444, MODAL","262, 401, CONTENT","466, 584, CONTENT","249, 261, ACTION","130, 197, CONTENT","240, 242, TRIGGER","105, 122, ACTION","85, 105, CONTENT","586, 598, TRIGGER","403, 420, CONTENT","76, 81, LOCATION","227, 232, MODAL","22, 48, CONTENT"}

10545	Lines 85-86: "First of all, this study includes 29 provinces in China."

10546	Lines 110-116: "Political stability in the country is also very important for the success of energy projects, according to many researchers. For example, Werner and Scholtens [25] examined energy projects in Germany and concluded that political problems in the country would affect energy investments. In parallel, Liu et al. [26], Ragosa and Warren [27] and Keeley and Ikeda [28] emphasized similar results in their studies. On the other hand, Li et al. [29] stated that volatility in the market will affect the success of energy investments. Also, Duan et al. [30], Liu and Zeng [31] and Peng et al. [32] argued that effective risk management will play an important role in this process." I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 8 (like the authors have did) or even more scientific works in a few lines just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section. The authors must introduce a presentation of the current state of the research field by reviewing it carefully and by citing key publications. By doing so, the problem will be put into context and it will benefit the readers as well. The purpose of the literature survey is to highlight for each of the involved referenced papers the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the method used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article. This is the only way to contextualize the current state of the art in which the authors of the manuscript position their paper and address aspects that have not been tackled/solved yet by the existing studies.	{"1078, 1083, MODAL","927, 937, ACTION","922, 927, MODAL","15, 690, LOCATION","0, 13, LOCATION","937, 1051, CONTENT","890, 908, LOCATION","710, 728, ACTION","729, 882, CONTENT","1115, 1123, ACTION","1545, 1715, CONTENT","1144, 1505, CONTENT","1531, 1545, ACTION","1507, 1527, CONTENT","1110, 1115, MODAL","1086, 1102, ACTION","1577, 1582, TRIGGER","269, 274, MODAL","0, 13, LOCATION","220, 229, ACTION"}
10547	The "Materials and Methods" section. It will benefit the manuscript if the authors include a "Materials and Methods" section (in the actual form of the manuscript this section is missing, being partially replaced by the section "3. Current trends of carbon dioxide emissions in China"), in which the new developed methods should be described  in detail while well-established methods (and information) can be briefly described and appropriately cited . The authors must restructure their manuscript in order to devise a proper "Materials and Methods" section, eventually structured in subsections. In order to bring a benefit to the manuscript, the authors should state and justify very clear in the "Materials and Methods" section, preferably within the first paragraph, the choices they have made when developing the final form of their proposed approach. The authors should state what has justified using  their approach, what is special, unexpected, or different in their research methodology.

In order to help the readers better understand the methodology of the conducted study, in the "Materials and Methods" section, the authors should devise a flowchart that depicts the steps that they have processed in developing  their research and most important of all, the final target. This flowchart will facilitate the understanding of the proposed approach and it will make the article more interesting  to the reader if used as a graphical abstract.

In this section, the authors must introduce a presentation of the current state of the research field by reviewing it carefully and by citing key publications. By doing so, the problem will be put into context and it will benefit the readers as well. The purpose of the literature survey is to highlight for each of the involved referenced papers the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the method used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article.

After having performed a critical survey of what has been done up to this point in the scientific literature, in the "Introduction" section, the authors must specify more clearly the gap in the current state of knowledge that they intend to fill with their proposed approach. The same gap must also be mentioned afterwards, in the "Discussion" section of the manuscript (which is currently missing from the manuscript) as well, where the authors should justify why their approach fills the identified gap in rapport with previous studies from the literature. In the final part of the "Introduction" section the authors must also declare the novel aspects of their work.

10599	Ø  The authors must assume clearly their original contribution by specifying this fact and by highlighting the fact that starting from a certain point there are presented the original and novel aspects of their research.

Consequently, a large amount of information contained by this section represents results from the scientific literature and therefore must be cited  starting from the beginning of this section. All the equations within the manuscript should be explained , demonstrated or cited, as there are some equations that have not been introduced in the literature for the first time by the authors and that are not cited.	{"344, 348, MODAL","166, 171, TRIGGER","351, 357, ACTION","67, 75, LOCATION","226, 329, CONTENT","210, 222, TRIGGER","77, 209, LOCATION","14, 40, LOCATION","479, 482, TRIGGER","608, 621, ACTION","547, 598, CONTENT","522, 546, ACTION","492, 516, CONTENT","482, 487, ACTION","466, 479, ACTION","454, 464, ACTION","433, 444, LOCATION","444, 451, MODAL","412, 421, CONTENT","359, 372, CONTENT","377, 402, LOCATION","352, 359, ACTION","344, 349, MODAL","334, 344, TRIGGER"}

11102	The Main Weak Point. I consider that the main weak point consists in the structure of the manuscript. If the authors make an effort to improve the structure of the manuscript and complement it with the recommendations from the specific comments, the authors will arrive at an article that can bring  a valuable insight to the current state of knowledge.	{"258, 262, MODAL","292, 298, ACTION","90, 100, LOCATION","143, 174, CONTENT","90, 100, LOCATION","135, 143, ACTION","179, 192, ACTION","66, 82, CONTENT","102, 105, TRIGGER","193, 244, CONTENT","41, 56, CONTENT","57, 65, ACTION"}
11103	Specific comments regarding the manuscript.	{"32, 42, LOCATION","32, 42, LOCATION","0, 17, CONTENT"}
11104	The sections of the manuscript. In the actual form of the paper, its sections are not according to the ones recommended by the Energies MDPI Journal's Template. The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the above-mentioned template that provides a more logical structure that is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to express better the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review should be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5. Conclusions (not mandatory), 6. Patents (not mandatory), Supplementary Materials (not mandatory), Author Contributions, Funding, Acknowledgments, Conflicts of Interest, Appendices and References.	{"108, 119, ACTION","20, 30, LOCATION","224, 363, CONTENT","211, 223, ACTION","165, 175, LOCATION","99, 159, CONTENT","600, 612, ACTION","590, 596, MODAL","626, 914, CONTENT","566, 576, LOCATION","189, 193, MODAL","69, 77, CONTENT","411, 415, ACTION","401, 405, MODAL","390, 400, LOCATION","365, 382, CONTENT","202, 205, TRIGGER","194, 202, ACTION","189, 194, MODAL","78, 95, ACTION","416, 546, CONTENT"}
11105	Lines 5-7 from the "Abstract" of the manuscript. At these lines, the authors state: "In this approach, instead of evaluating a single-point forecast, an intraday interval prediction is provided which allows to measure the variability of the wind speed process at any specific hour." The authors must reformulate this sentence, as a prediction cannot allow to measure anything  (rather allows to estimate), it can only provide a forecasting  with a certain level of accuracy, useful in various purposes.	{"37, 47, LOCATION","312, 502, CONTENT","300, 311, ACTION","295, 299, MODAL","84, 282, LOCATION","194, 199, TRIGGER","295, 299, MODAL","77, 82, ACTION","0, 9, LOCATION","0, 9, LOCATION","19, 29, LOCATION","52, 63, LOCATION"}
11106	The "Introduction" section. I consider that the literature review should be improved by performing a careful analysis of the cited  works. The authors must highlight exactly, for each of the involved referenced papers the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the methods used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article. This is the only way to contextualize the current state of the art in which the authors of the manuscript position their paper, identify and address aspects that have not been tackled/solved yet by the existing studies.	{"556, 561, TRIGGER","44, 65, CONTENT","66, 72, MODAL","4, 26, LOCATION","76, 84, ACTION","524, 705, CONTENT","151, 155, MODAL","156, 165, ACTION","510, 523, ACTION","166, 485, CONTENT","88, 137, CONTENT","5, 17, LOCATION","75, 130, ACTION","66, 72, MODAL","486, 506, CONTENT"}
11107	The "Introduction" section. In the "Introduction" section, the authors must state more clearly a gap in the current state of knowledge that needs to be filled, a gap that is being addressed by their manuscript.	{"71, 75, MODAL","71, 81, ACTION","5, 17, LOCATION","82, 210, CONTENT","76, 81, ACTION","35, 57, LOCATION","4, 26, LOCATION"}
11108	The "Materials and Methods" section. It will benefit the paper if the authors restructure the actual content of sections 2, 3 and 4 into a "Materials and methods" section (eventually structured in subsections), in which the new developed methods are described in detail while well-established methods (and information) are briefly described and appropriately cited. In order to bring a benefit to the manuscript, the authors should state and justify very clear in the "Materials and Methods" section, preferably within the first paragraph, the choices they have made when developing the final form of their proposed approach. The authors should state what has justified using  this approach, what is special, unexpected, or different in their research methodology. It will benefit if the authors mention if they have tried other approaches that in the end led them to the current form of their research design.	{"804, 910, CONTENT","697, 763, CONTENT","692, 696, TRIGGER","656, 690, CONTENT","651, 655, TRIGGER","645, 650, ACTION","638, 644, MODAL","540, 624, CONTENT","523, 538, LOCATION","468, 499, LOCATION","442, 449, ACTION","432, 437, ACTION","425, 431, MODAL","220, 365, CONTENT","139, 170, LOCATION","112, 131, LOCATION","90, 108, CONTENT","78, 89, ACTION","4, 35, LOCATION","214, 219, TRIGGER","40, 44, MODAL","250, 259, ACTION","112, 122, LOCATION","796, 803, ACTION","56, 62, LOCATION","40, 44, MODAL","45, 52, ACTION","63, 65, TRIGGER","172, 208, CONTENT","768, 772, MODAL","773, 780, ACTION","781, 783, TRIGGER"}
11109	The "Materials and Methods" section. In order to help the readers better understand the methodology of the conducted study, in the "Materials and Methods" section, the authors should devise a flowchart that depicts the steps that they have processed in developing  their research and most important of all, the final target. This flowchart will facilitate the understanding of the proposed approach and in the same time will make the article more interesting  to the readers if used as a graphical abstract.	{"478, 506, CONTENT","475, 477, TRIGGER","430, 474, CONTENT","425, 429, ACTION","420, 424, MODAL","356, 398, CONTENT","345, 355, ACTION","340, 344, MODAL","325, 339, CONTENT","190, 324, CONTENT","176, 182, MODAL","131, 162, LOCATION","4, 35, LOCATION","498, 506, LOCATION","183, 189, ACTION","182, 263, ACTION","340, 344, MODAL"}
11110	The equations within the manuscript. All the equations within the manuscript should be explained , demonstrated or cited, as there are some equations that have not been introduced in the literature for the first time by the authors and that are not cited.	{"25, 35, LOCATION","115, 120, ACTION","99, 111, ACTION","87, 96, ACTION","77, 83, MODAL","66, 76, LOCATION","160, 179, ACTION","180, 231, CONTENT","86, 96, ACTION","77, 83, MODAL","135, 149, CONTENT","112, 114, TRIGGER","37, 54, CONTENT","241, 254, ACTION"}
11111	The datasets used. At Lines 188-192, the authors state: "Formally, we have hourly time series of WS, WD and T measured in these sites between 16/07/2008 and 31/08/2010 in Masdar City, 06/06/2008 and 31/08/2010 in Madinat Zayed, 01/06/2007 and 31/08/2010 in Al Aradh and Bani Yas Island." First of all, from these lines one can observe that data from different sites refer to different periods of time. I consider that the authors should explain within the manuscript if the overall dataset provided for the 3 different sites is consistent in the context of the actual study, as they refer to different periods of time.	{"56, 287, LOCATION","22, 35, LOCATION","430, 436, MODAL","467, 618, CONTENT","22, 35, LOCATION","13, 17, ACTION","456, 466, LOCATION","437, 444, ACTION","323, 326, MODAL"}
11112	Secondly, I would like the authors to provide more details regarding  the used datasets. In order to be able to verify the relevance and correctness of the developed model, in the supplementary materials the authors must provide all the necessary details in order to allow other researchers to verify, reproduce, discuss and extend the obtained scientific results based on the obtained published results. Other researchers should not have to obtain and concatenate the data sets from various sources, risking in acquiring different datasets or datasets that have been normalized differently than the datasets on which the authors have performed their experimental tests and validations. The exact datasets that the authors have used will be a valuable addition to the manuscript if they can be provided  as supplementary materials to the manuscript as the authors must provide all the necessary details in order to allow other researchers to verify, reproduce, discuss and extend the obtained published results of the authors.	{"180, 193, LOCATION","17, 68, ACTION","216, 220, MODAL","612, 617, TRIGGER","877, 1026, CONTENT","180, 203, LOCATION","38, 45, ACTION","12, 17, MODAL","733, 737, MODAL","738, 760, ACTION","768, 778, LOCATION","778, 781, TRIGGER","787, 790, MODAL","229, 403, CONTENT","216, 220, MODAL","221, 228, ACTION","687, 732, CONTENT","864, 868, MODAL","794, 802, ACTION","807, 830, LOCATION","869, 876, ACTION","46, 87, CONTENT"}
11113	Thirdly, I would like the authors to comment in the paper whether the data collected during  the period 2008-2010 are still relevant today, in 2020, in what concerns the same targeted problems. The authors should provide explanations whether their study is consistent, whether the changes that may occur within the older dataset from the above-mentioned period and the current year risk altering the final result.	{"213, 220, ACTION","221, 413, CONTENT","11, 16, MODAL","52, 57, LOCATION","37, 44, ACTION","58, 193, CONTENT","206, 212, MODAL","206, 212, MODAL","152, 156, TRIGGER","16, 91, ACTION"}
11114	Moreover, the authors must provide more details regarding the preprocessing approach that they have used and the way in which they intend to solve the problems related to missing  data or abnormal values if they are to occur.	{"26, 178, ACTION","120, 125, TRIGGER","0, 8, TRIGGER","35, 225, CONTENT","27, 34, ACTION","22, 26, MODAL"}
11115	The tables and figures from section 5 of the paper. In its actual form, the section 5 of the paper entitled "Application to wind speed data" contains a lot of insufficiently interpreted and explained tables and figures, spreading along the pages 12-15. The authors must explain and analyze in detail all the tables and figures that have been inserted within the manuscript, it is not suitable to put the reader in the situation of interpreting, analyzing, continuing or refining the study from the manuscript under review.	{"150, 252, CONTENT","141, 149, ACTION","362, 372, LOCATION","290, 350, CONTENT","282, 289, ACTION","270, 277, ACTION","265, 269, MODAL","108, 140, LOCATION","93, 98, LOCATION","76, 85, LOCATION","45, 50, LOCATION","28, 37, LOCATION","393, 488, CONTENT","498, 508, LOCATION","377, 392, ACTION","0, 22, CONTENT","190, 199, ACTION","4, 10, LOCATION"}
11116	The devised approach. At Lines 231-235, the authors state: "It is easy to observe a seasonality in the times series. However, the correlation between daily wind speed, wind direction and temperature is less easy to observe. For that reason we will not use the temperature and the wind direction as covariates to predict wind speed." These statements rise a series of issues, as the wind speed is strongly influenced by the air temperature variations between different moments of the day, or from season to season due to changes in the heating of the Earth's atmosphere, caused by the sun's warming effect. Warm air is less dense than cold air, so warm air rides up and over the cold air, causing winds. Taking into account these facts, I consider that the above-mentioned statements are lacking scientific soundness, and they must be refined , reformulated and justified.	{"243, 247, MODAL","25, 38, LOCATION","52, 57, ACTION","117, 124, TRIGGER","844, 856, ACTION","861, 870, ACTION","25, 38, LOCATION","783, 794, ACTION","756, 782, CONTENT","59, 332, LOCATION","795, 815, CONTENT","826, 830, MODAL","834, 841, ACTION"}
11117	The "Discussion" section. In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Discussion" section (which is currently missing from the manuscript), the authors should make a comparison between their approach from the manuscript and other similar ones that have been developed in the literature for the same or related purposes. There are a lot of valuable studies in the scientific literature related to the subject of the manuscript to which the authors can compare to and this comparison will highlight even more the novel aspects that their paper brought in contrast to the existing   studies.	{"116, 136, ACTION","26, 79, CONTENT","110, 115, TRIGGER","146, 156, LOCATION","339, 426, CONTENT","434, 444, LOCATION","466, 469, MODAL","470, 477, ACTION","485, 500, CONTENT","501, 506, MODAL","506, 516, ACTION","516, 606, CONTENT","4, 24, LOCATION","88, 108, LOCATION","171, 177, MODAL","178, 182, ACTION","183, 338, CONTENT","171, 177, MODAL","5, 15, LOCATION","129, 136, ACTION","110, 115, TRIGGER"}
11118	The "Discussion" section. In the "Discussion" section the authors should also highlight current limitations of their study, and briefly mention some precise directions that they intend to follow in their future research work.	{"5, 15, LOCATION","136, 143, ACTION","66, 72, MODAL","78, 87, ACTION","88, 122, CONTENT","144, 225, CONTENT","136, 143, ACTION","4, 24, LOCATION","33, 53, LOCATION","66, 72, MODAL"}
11119	The "Discussion" section. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their analysis and provide an insight at the end of the "Discussion" section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained results, the most important, appropriate and concrete actions that the decisional factors and all the involved parties should take in order to benefit from the results of the research conducted within the manuscript.	{"52, 56, MODAL","65, 68, TRIGGER","80, 99, ACTION","153, 184, LOCATION","4, 24, LOCATION","127, 134, ACTION","135, 145, CONTENT","185, 459, CONTENT","45, 51, LOCATION","57, 64, ACTION","195, 199, TRIGGER","5, 15, LOCATION","52, 56, MODAL"}
11120	The "Discussion" section. The scientific value of the "Discussion" section and of the manuscript under review will be considerably increased if the authors provide an insight regarding the feasibility of implementing their proposed  approach in a real production environment, taking also into consideration the associated costs for the necessary software and hardware equipment.	{"110, 114, MODAL","117, 231, ACTION","5, 15, LOCATION","55, 74, LOCATION","86, 96, LOCATION","141, 143, TRIGGER","156, 163, ACTION","131, 140, ACTION","110, 114, MODAL","164, 378, CONTENT","4, 24, LOCATION"}

11122	The references. According to the Energies MDPI Journal's Template, the references must be numbered  in the order of their appearance in the text (including citations in tables and legends) and listed individually at the end of the manuscript. In the actual form of the paper, the references are ordered in an alphabetical order instead of the recommended one.

In this paper, the authors analyze an optimization model for cold chain logistics distribution, taking into consideration three factors: the cost, the customer satisfaction and the reducing of the carbon emissions.	{"65, 185, LOCATION","59, 64, LOCATION","195, 200, LOCATION","20, 30, LOCATION"}
11126	If the above-mentioned problems are solved, I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors address within the manuscript the following  aspects:	{"117, 127, LOCATION","13, 22, ACTION","117, 127, LOCATION","128, 151, CONTENT","64, 69, LOCATION","70, 75, MODAL","75, 82, ACTION","83, 85, TRIGGER","98, 105, ACTION"}

11128	Ø  The sections of the manuscript. In the actual form of the paper, its sections are not according to the ones recommended by the template of the "International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health". The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the above-mentioned template that provides a more logical structure that is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to better express the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review should be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5. Conclusions (not mandatory), 6. Patents (not mandatory), Supplementary Materials (not mandatory), Author Contributions, Funding, Acknowledgments, Conflicts of Interest, Appendices and References. Another issue regarding the sections consists in the fact that many titles of subsections (for example: Line 21 on page 2, title of the subsection 2.1; Line 40 on page 2, title of the subsection 2.2; Line 14 on page 3, title of the subsection 2.3 and many others) are starting with lowercase.	{"23, 33, LOCATION","111, 122, ACTION","243, 247, MODAL","1132, 1138, LOCATION","1121, 1128, LOCATION","1092, 1119, LOCATION","99, 214, CONTENT","1084, 1090, LOCATION","1073, 1080, LOCATION","219, 229, LOCATION","265, 277, ACTION","278, 418, CONTENT","644, 650, MODAL","654, 666, ACTION","1037, 1058, LOCATION","465, 470, ACTION","482, 600, CONTENT","620, 630, LOCATION","668, 967, CONTENT","71, 80, CONTENT","81, 99, ACTION","243, 248, MODAL","248, 255, ACTION","256, 258, TRIGGER","419, 436, CONTENT","444, 454, LOCATION","455, 460, MODAL","1246, 1261, CONTENT","1233, 1245, ACTION","1180, 1186, LOCATION","1188, 1215, LOCATION","1169, 1176, LOCATION","1140, 1167, LOCATION"}
11129	Ø  Lines 10-21 on page 1, the "Abstract" of the paper. Taking into consideration that this is a research article, the abstract should offer a relevant overview of the work. It will benefit the paper if the authors provide a structured abstract, that covers the following aspects: the background (in which the authors should place the issue that the manuscript addresses in a broad context and highlight the purpose of the study), the methods used to solve the identified issue (that should be briefly described ), a summary of the article's main findings followed by the main conclusions or interpretations. In the abstract the authors must also declare and briefly justify the novelty of their work. In the actual form of the manuscript, the abstract offers information related only to some of these aspects and even so, their delimitation is unclear.	{"3, 14, LOCATION","18, 24, LOCATION","30, 40, LOCATION","48, 53, LOCATION","118, 126, LOCATION","127, 133, MODAL","134, 139, ACTION","140, 172, CONTENT","214, 221, ACTION","222, 294, CONTENT","317, 323, MODAL","324, 329, ACTION","330, 427, CONTENT","430, 476, CONTENT","483, 489, MODAL","501, 510, ACTION","514, 607, CONTENT","615, 623, LOCATION","636, 640, MODAL","646, 653, ACTION","666, 673, ACTION","674, 700, CONTENT","3, 14, LOCATION","442, 446, ACTION","127, 133, MODAL","299, 304, TRIGGER"}
11130	Ø  The "Introduction" section and the "Literature Review" section. After having performed a critical survey of what has been done up to this point in the scientific literature, the authors must identify a gap in the current state of knowledge that needs to be filled, a gap that is being addressed by their manuscript. This gap must also be used afterwards, in the "Discussion" section of the manuscript which is currently missing from the manuscript) as well, where the authors should justify why their approach fills the identified gap in rapport with previous studies from the literature. In the "Introduction" section the authors must also declare the novel aspects of their work.	{"8, 20, LOCATION","224, 229, ACTION","189, 193, MODAL","111, 115, TRIGGER","652, 684, CONTENT","404, 409, TRIGGER","440, 450, LOCATION","410, 430, ACTION","7, 29, LOCATION","38, 65, LOCATION","189, 193, MODAL","194, 202, ACTION","203, 318, CONTENT","328, 332, MODAL","341, 345, ACTION","319, 327, CONTENT","365, 385, LOCATION","393, 403, LOCATION","599, 621, LOCATION","498, 591, CONTENT","494, 497, TRIGGER","486, 493, ACTION","479, 485, MODAL","634, 638, MODAL","644, 651, ACTION"}
11131	Ø  The "Materials and Methods" section is missing. I consider that it will benefit the manuscript if the authors include a "Materials and Methods" section (in the actual form of the manuscript this section is missing), in which the new developed methods should be described  in detail while well-established methods (and information) can be briefly described and appropriately cited .	{"275, 284, CONTENT","7, 38, LOCATION","39, 49, ACTION","113, 120, ACTION","123, 154, LOCATION","182, 192, LOCATION","193, 205, LOCATION","206, 216, ACTION","228, 253, CONTENT","254, 260, MODAL","291, 333, CONTENT","349, 358, ACTION","377, 382, ACTION","264, 273, ACTION","334, 337, MODAL","42, 49, ACTION","87, 97, LOCATION","70, 74, MODAL","222, 227, TRIGGER"}
11132	Ø  The flowchart. In order to help the readers better understand the methodology of the conducted study, in the "Materials and Methods" section the authors should devise a flowchart that depicts the steps that they have processed in developing  their research and most important of all, the final target. This flowchart will facilitate the understanding of the proposed approach and in the same time will make the article more interesting  to the readers if used as a graphical abstract.	{"478, 486, LOCATION","162, 243, ACTION","320, 324, MODAL","112, 143, LOCATION","335, 378, CONTENT","310, 319, LOCATION","163, 169, ACTION","409, 486, CONTENT","405, 409, ACTION","400, 404, MODAL","325, 335, ACTION","170, 303, CONTENT","320, 324, MODAL","156, 162, MODAL"}
11133	Ø  The equations. All the equations within the manuscript should be explained , demonstrated or cited, as there are some equations that have not been introduced in the literature for the first time by the authors and that are not cited. In the equations (1)-(4), the authors should use an appropriate mathematical formalism, instead of combining text and mathematical symbols. Please revise and improve the mathematical formalism.	{"96, 101, ACTION","47, 57, LOCATION","58, 64, MODAL","68, 77, ACTION","80, 92, ACTION","121, 130, LOCATION","141, 160, ACTION","161, 212, CONTENT","226, 235, ACTION","244, 261, LOCATION","275, 281, MODAL","282, 285, ACTION","286, 376, CONTENT","384, 390, ACTION","395, 402, ACTION","403, 432, CONTENT","93, 95, TRIGGER","18, 35, CONTENT","58, 64, MODAL","47, 57, LOCATION","67, 77, ACTION"}
11134	Ø  Lines 41-48 on page 3, Lines 1-11 on Page 4, Subsection 3.1, Problem Description. The assumption 2 is impossible to be practically attained: "All vehicles travel at a constant speed and keep the same speed during transport." I consider that the authors should specify in the paper whether neglecting  the traffic congestion that tends to occur frequently does not affect the consistency of their study.	{"3, 14, LOCATION","262, 302, ACTION","18, 24, LOCATION","26, 36, LOCATION","40, 46, LOCATION","48, 62, LOCATION","64, 83, LOCATION","144, 227, LOCATION","256, 262, MODAL","263, 270, ACTION","278, 283, LOCATION","284, 405, CONTENT","3, 14, LOCATION"}
11135	Ø  Line 27 on page 4, table 1. The authors state that the symbol "N" represents "The Set of customers", but actually "N" is the number of customers.	{"117, 120, LOCATION","124, 148, CONTENT","121, 123, ACTION","104, 107, TRIGGER","80, 102, LOCATION","65, 68, LOCATION","22, 29, LOCATION","14, 20, LOCATION","3, 10, LOCATION","43, 48, ACTION","3, 10, LOCATION","104, 107, TRIGGER"}
11136	Ø  The "Discussion" section is missing. In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Discussion" section (which is currently missing from the manuscript), the authors should make a comparison between their approach from the manuscript and other similar ones that have been developed in the literature for the same or related purposes. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their analysis and provide an insight at the end of the "Discussion" section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained results, the most important, appropriate and concrete actions that the decisional factors and all the involved parties should take in order to benefit from the results of the research conducted within the manuscript.	{"185, 191, MODAL","8, 18, LOCATION","31, 38, ACTION","124, 129, TRIGGER","130, 150, ACTION","102, 122, LOCATION","28, 38, ACTION","8, 27, LOCATION","462, 472, CONTENT","480, 511, LOCATION","512, 786, CONTENT","192, 196, ACTION","124, 129, TRIGGER","197, 352, CONTENT","454, 461, ACTION","185, 191, MODAL","160, 170, LOCATION"}
11137	Ø  The Figures from the paper. In Figures 1-5, the titles and the measurement units of both axes are missing. Regarding Figures 3-5: for consistency reasons, in a scientific article one should not represent on the same chart different physical entities, having different meanings and measurement units. Consequently, the authors should present different charts for the different entities.	{"196, 206, ACTION","186, 196, MODAL","24, 29, LOCATION","34, 45, LOCATION","47, 96, CONTENT","344, 388, CONTENT","97, 108, ACTION","120, 131, LOCATION","207, 303, CONTENT","329, 335, MODAL","336, 343, ACTION","101, 108, ACTION","7, 14, LOCATION","186, 192, MODAL"}
11138	Ø  Line 24 on page 8. "We consider the experiment based on a case study from a cold chain transport company [47]." I would like the authors to provide more details regarding  the dataset. Moreover, since reference 47 is published in 2014, I would like the authors to comment in the paper whether the data collected previously (probably before 2014) are still relevant today, in 2019, in what concerns the same problem. The authors should provide explanations whether their study is consistent, whether the changes that may occur within the older dataset from the above-mentioned period and the current year risk altering the final result. Another important issue regards the above-mentioned reference [47]. Please provide more details regarding this work, as in the current form of the paper these details are missing in the References section. Is it a book, a scientific paper, a conference paper or a thesis? Is it publicly available? I could not find it anywhere. Therefore, the authors should either provide more details, or offer another reference that can be found and consulted .	{"117, 122, MODAL","3, 10, LOCATION","122, 173, ACTION","188, 196, TRIGGER","267, 274, ACTION","1035, 1086, CONTENT","1029, 1034, ACTION","1012, 1024, CONTENT","1004, 1011, ACTION","990, 996, MODAL","825, 843, LOCATION","806, 817, ACTION","792, 805, CONTENT","786, 791, LOCATION","722, 754, CONTENT","714, 721, ACTION","691, 705, LOCATION","446, 639, CONTENT","438, 445, ACTION","431, 437, MODAL","288, 418, CONTENT","282, 287, LOCATION","204, 216, LOCATION","188, 196, TRIGGER","151, 188, CONTENT","143, 150, ACTION","22, 114, LOCATION","14, 20, LOCATION","3, 10, LOCATION","845, 909, CONTENT","911, 935, CONTENT","939, 948, MODAL","949, 953, ACTION","954, 965, CONTENT","1026, 1028, TRIGGER"}
11139	Ø  Line 10 page 1, in the Abstract.

11140	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: energies-572483, having the title "Performance Assessment of a Biogas-based CCHP Plant: an Absorption Refrigeration System Integrated to an Externally Fired Microturbine for Small-scale Applications". In this paper, the authors propose a combined, cooling, heat and power (CCHP) solution. This solution considers the use of biogas for the operation of an externally fired microturbine (EFMT) where electricity and heat (recovered from the combustion gas through heat exchangers) are produced. After comparing their obtained results to the reference energy solutions (fossil fuel-based technologies where electricity, cooling and hot water are produced separately), the authors state that the biogas-based CCHP system is competitive since it allows savings in primary energy. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors address within the manuscript the following  aspects:	{"158, 168, ACTION","20, 30, LOCATION","427, 432, TRIGGER","836, 840, MODAL","849, 851, TRIGGER","841, 848, ACTION","894, 917, CONTENT","883, 893, LOCATION","864, 871, ACTION","244, 249, LOCATION","69, 234, LOCATION","63, 68, LOCATION","830, 835, LOCATION"}
11141	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: energies-563441, having the title "A discussion on the effective ventilation distance in dead-end tunnels". In this paper, the authors analyze a series of possible arrangements influencing the formation of the dead zone in a dead-end tunnel, by using computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) models. The authors state that their obtained results may assist civil and mining engineers to improve ventilation efficiency in tunnels and mine galleries during  construction works. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors address within the manuscript the following  aspects:	{"151, 156, LOCATION","589, 612, CONTENT","545, 547, TRIGGER","537, 545, ACTION","532, 537, MODAL","526, 531, LOCATION","69, 141, LOCATION","560, 567, ACTION","579, 589, LOCATION","20, 30, LOCATION","280, 285, ACTION"}
11142	Ø General remarks about the paper. The Manuscript ID: energies-563441 is interesting, but it still remains an aspect that must be emphasized and strengthened  more by the authors, namely the fact that they must assume more clearly the advancement to the current state of knowledge. I consider that the authors must assume more clearly in the paper their original contribution by specifying this fact and by highlighting the fact that starting from a certain point there are presented the original and novel aspects of their research. The authors must state more clearly their original methods, their original results and conclusions, the novelty of their study.	{"39, 49, LOCATION","129, 157, ACTION","122, 126, MODAL","86, 89, TRIGGER","180, 195, CONTENT","570, 661, CONTENT","107, 116, CONTENT","122, 126, MODAL","546, 550, MODAL","551, 556, ACTION","206, 210, MODAL","130, 140, ACTION","347, 533, CONTENT","342, 347, LOCATION","145, 157, ACTION","315, 321, ACTION","310, 314, MODAL","217, 281, CONTENT","211, 217, ACTION","86, 89, TRIGGER"}
11143	Ø The sections of the manuscript in its actual form are: 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and methods, 3. Results and discussion, 5. Conclusions, Authors' Contribution, Acknowledgments, Conflicts of Interest, References. Even if the sections are generally according to the ones recommended by the Energies MDPI Journal's Template, in the actual form of the manuscript after the section numbered with "3", comes the section numbered with "5". The authors must address this inconsistency.	{"127, 141, LOCATION","450, 456, MODAL","464, 483, CONTENT","456, 463, ACTION","412, 437, LOCATION","375, 400, LOCATION","354, 364, LOCATION","230, 238, LOCATION","206, 216, LOCATION","183, 204, LOCATION","166, 181, LOCATION","143, 164, LOCATION","6, 14, LOCATION","22, 32, LOCATION","57, 72, LOCATION","74, 98, LOCATION","100, 125, LOCATION","60, 72, LOCATION","275, 286, ACTION","451, 455, MODAL"}
11144	Ø Lines 10-22, the Abstract of the paper. In the "Abstract" of the paper, the authors must present in a clearer manner the following  aspects: the background, the methods, the main findings, the conclusions, as in the actual form of the manuscript, the abstract offers information related only to some of these aspects and even so, their delimitation is unclear. In the "Abstract" of the paper, along with the above-mentioned elements, the authors should briefly state the novelty of their proposed approach.	{"448, 454, MODAL","2, 13, LOCATION","90, 132, ACTION","370, 380, LOCATION","469, 508, CONTENT","463, 469, ACTION","448, 454, MODAL","388, 393, LOCATION","99, 362, CONTENT","91, 98, ACTION","86, 90, MODAL","67, 72, LOCATION","49, 59, LOCATION","35, 40, LOCATION","19, 27, LOCATION","2, 13, LOCATION"}
11145	Ø Lines 25-53, the "Nomenclature" section. This section should be placed  at the end of the paper, not at its beginning, before the "Introduction" section.	{"121, 155, LOCATION","99, 102, TRIGGER","2, 13, LOCATION","19, 41, LOCATION","43, 55, LOCATION","56, 62, MODAL","66, 72, ACTION","81, 97, LOCATION","106, 119, LOCATION","65, 72, ACTION","2, 13, LOCATION","56, 62, MODAL"}
11146	Ø Lines 87-89, the "Introduction" section. "CFDs models have been used in several aspects of mine ventilation, such as, dust control (e.g. [8]; [7]), fires and explosions ([9]; [10]), heat control [11], coal heating [12]; [13], as well as heading developments ([14]; [15]; [16]; [17]; [18])." I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 12 (like the authors have did) or even more scientific works in a few lines just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section. In the "Introduction" section, the authors must introduce a presentation of the current state of the research field by reviewing it carefully and by citing more other key publications. By doing so, the problem will be put into context and it will benefit the readers as well. The purpose of the literature survey is to highlight for each of the involved referenced papers the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the methods used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article. This is the only way to contextualize the current state of the art in which the authors of the manuscript position their paper and address aspects that have not been tackled/solved yet by the existing studies from the body of knowledge in contrast with the manuscript under review. In the "Introduction" section, after having performed the appropriate review of the scientific articles/studies that tackle similar or related problems with the one of the manuscript, the authors must identify and state clearly in the manuscript a gap in the current state of knowledge that they intend to fill with their proposed approach. The same gap must also be tackled afterwards, in the "Discussion" section of the manuscript as well, where the authors should justify why their approach fills the identified gap in rapport with previous studies from the literature. In addition to these aspects, at the end of the Introduction, the authors should preview the structure of their paper, under the form: "The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 contains…".	{"1223, 1228, TRIGGER","2, 13, LOCATION","66, 70, ACTION","556, 560, MODAL","789, 1151, CONTENT","711, 722, CONTENT","2097, 2213, CONTENT","2089, 2096, ACTION","2082, 2088, MODAL","2045, 2068, LOCATION","1914, 2007, CONTENT","1910, 1913, TRIGGER","1902, 1909, ACTION","1895, 1901, MODAL","1857, 1867, LOCATION","1829, 1849, LOCATION","1681, 1775, CONTENT","1670, 1680, LOCATION","1649, 1654, ACTION","1636, 1644, ACTION","1631, 1635, MODAL","1442, 1464, LOCATION","1177, 1190, ACTION","571, 697, CONTENT","561, 570, ACTION","556, 560, MODAL","520, 542, LOCATION","312, 330, ACTION","43, 292, LOCATION","19, 41, LOCATION","2, 13, LOCATION","1153, 1174, CONTENT","1191, 1433, CONTENT","723, 728, MODAL","1776, 1788, CONTENT","1789, 1793, MODAL","1802, 1809, ACTION","731, 747, ACTION","755, 759, MODAL","760, 767, ACTION","331, 485, CONTENT","493, 511, LOCATION"}
11147	Ø The authors must improve the mathematical formalism, must revise the notations and their significance, paying more attention to the details, as in the current form of the manuscript a series of details are missing. For example, the authors must explain what is the meaning  of the notation S that appears in Figure 1, Line 75, of the notation S that appears at Lines 78-79, and of the notation S from Table 1, Line 107? As the notation cannot have the same significance in these cases, then why was the same notation used?	{"363, 374, LOCATION","55, 59, MODAL","383, 397, CONTENT","60, 66, ACTION","66, 141, CONTENT","173, 183, LOCATION","184, 203, CONTENT","204, 215, ACTION","242, 246, MODAL","247, 254, ACTION","255, 259, TRIGGER","260, 293, CONTENT","310, 318, LOCATION","14, 18, MODAL","19, 26, ACTION","403, 410, LOCATION","497, 523, CONTENT","493, 496, TRIGGER","412, 420, LOCATION","26, 53, CONTENT","320, 327, LOCATION","332, 346, CONTENT","255, 259, TRIGGER","173, 183, LOCATION","208, 215, ACTION","14, 18, MODAL"}
11148	Ø The "Materials and Methods" section.

11159	In this paper, the author develops a short-term load forecasting model designed in order to improve the accuracy and stability of load prediction. In this purpose, he proposes a hybrid model that combines fuzzy clustering (FC), least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) and wolf pack algorithm (WPA). On the basis of load characteristics’ analysis for e-bus charging station, FC is adopted to extract samples on similar days, which can not only avoid the blindness of selecting  similar days by experience, but also overcome the adverse effects of unconventional load data caused by sudden change of factors on training. Then, the author employs WPA with good global convergence and computational robustness in order to optimize the parameters of LSSVM. Consequently, in the paper is developed a hybrid load forecasting model for quick-change e-bus charging station, namely FC-WPA-LSSVM. In order to verify the developed model, the author uses for model construction and testing two case studies. The author states that the simulation test results prove that the proposed model can obtain high prediction accuracy and ideal stability.	{"3, 13, LOCATION","435, 438, MODAL","438, 480, ACTION","429, 434, TRIGGER"}

The author should analyze if these neglected factors have a limited impact on the load curves or it could be that these factors' influences are already included to a great extent in the existing data, otherwise the entire study risks to become inconsistent. Due to the fact that the limitation of data obstructs a thorough analysis regarding the impact of these factors, I consider that it is worth analyzing whether using an additional forecasting method is needed in order to predict the impact of these factors that might cause a supplementary amount of energy load when events such as traffic congestions occur.	{"825, 1031, CONTENT","25, 216, LOCATION","266, 271, LOCATION","272, 415, CONTENT","427, 433, MODAL","434, 441, ACTION","442, 673, CONTENT","10, 23, LOCATION","815, 824, ACTION","251, 258, ACTION","244, 250, MODAL","244, 250, MODAL","10, 23, LOCATION","250, 290, ACTION","985, 989, TRIGGER"}

11226	§  The article’s structure should be improved in order to make the article more comprehensible as in its current form it is not structured  appropriately. The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the Template of the MDPI ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information that provides a more logical structure that is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to better express the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review should be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5.

11228	§  In what concerns the abstract, I consider that the authors should structure it as to cover the most important points of interest: the authors should have positioned the manuscript’s topic in a broad context therefore covering appropriately the topic’s background; the authors should have presented succinctly the methods they have employed  in order to attain the purpose of their study; the authors should have summarized the most important outcomes of their study and the conclusion that one could draw. I consider that the abstract of the manuscript under review will be improved  if the authors state and explain concisely at the end of the abstract the clear contribution that their study has brought to the current state of knowledge.	{"291, 300, ACTION","6, 10, TRIGGER","62, 68, MODAL","24, 32, LOCATION","301, 389, CONTENT","529, 537, LOCATION","544, 555, LOCATION","569, 573, MODAL","577, 585, ACTION","587, 590, TRIGGER","24, 32, LOCATION","62, 68, MODAL","69, 78, ACTION","85, 131, CONTENT","145, 151, MODAL","152, 167, ACTION","168, 265, CONTENT","279, 285, MODAL","286, 300, ACTION","403, 409, MODAL","410, 425, ACTION","426, 508, CONTENT","602, 608, ACTION","612, 619, ACTION","637, 656, LOCATION","657, 743, CONTENT"}
11229	Ø Comments regarding the "Introduction" section:	{"25, 47, LOCATION","26, 38, LOCATION"}
11230	§  In the Introduction section, the authors stated clearly the motivation for the work presented in the manuscript and they have prepared the readers for the structure of the paper. The authors have tried to address the context, need, task, and finally they have detailed the subsequent structuring of the paper.	{"10, 22, LOCATION","44, 50, ACTION","10, 30, LOCATION"}
11233	§  Finally, the authors previewed the remainder of the paper in order to prepare the readers for the subsequent structuring of the manuscript.	{"73, 80, ACTION","131, 141, LOCATION","131, 141, LOCATION","55, 60, LOCATION"}
11234	§  I have serious concerns regarding the way how the authors of the manuscript under review have performed the literature review.  In a scientific article, an important role of the“Introduction” section is to offer authors the opportunity to analyze in detail the current state of knowledge related to the manuscript’s topic, namely the most relevant scientific works in the field in order to be able to contextualize their study and familiarize the readers with what has been done in the literature and what advancement their study aims to bring in addition to the existing body of knowledge. I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover eight (like the authors have did) or even more scientific works in a short sentence just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section.	{"632, 794, CONTENT","613, 631, ACTION","180, 202, LOCATION","802, 820, LOCATION","68, 78, LOCATION","272, 277, ACTION","45, 48, TRIGGER"}
11235	§  I consider that the authors should perform the literature review in a manner that emphasizes for each scientific work that was cited in the text of the manuscript the contribution that was made to the existing state of art, the approach that was employed along with a short description of the most important results that have been obtained along with the existing unsolved issues of the referenced studies. By doing so, the authors will be able to better place their study in a broad body of knowledge and highlight unsolved  problems that still exist regarding the subject that their manuscript addresses.	{"143, 147, LOCATION","37, 212, ACTION","435, 439, MODAL","46, 409, CONTENT","38, 45, ACTION","31, 37, MODAL","518, 576, CONTENT","464, 504, CONTENT","509, 518, ACTION","439, 464, ACTION","435, 439, MODAL"}
11236	§  The authors have cited some valuable works from the current state of art, works that are relevant to their study, but the literature review conducted within the Introduction section should be extended  as to cover a higher number of important scientific works from the literature (there are a lot of valuable open access studies in the MDPI platform that can be easily accessed ) and must be performed in a critical manner like I have explained  in the above comments.	{"185, 191, MODAL","284, 353, CONTENT","164, 184, LOCATION","121, 152, CONTENT","372, 381, ACTION","205, 282, CONTENT","387, 391, MODAL","358, 361, MODAL","405, 471, CONTENT","395, 404, ACTION","195, 203, ACTION","185, 191, MODAL","164, 176, LOCATION","63, 68, ACTION","117, 120, TRIGGER"}
11237	§  After having extended and performed the literature survey in an appropriate manner, the authors will be able to pin point an exact deficiency, an unsolved problem that still exists in the current body of knowledge that their study addresses. In the current form of the manuscript the authors have identified a deficiency, but I consider that this deficiency is not substantiated enough due to an improper survey of the literature review that must be addressed  appropriately. This aspect will improve the manuscript under review on multiple plans, as the identified deficiency, the identified unsolved problem will offer great opportunities to highlight and prove in the Discussion section the contribution, the advancement that the conducted research has brought to the existing state of knowledge.	{"325, 328, TRIGGER","99, 103, MODAL","452, 462, ACTION","272, 282, LOCATION","693, 801, CONTENT","99, 104, MODAL","115, 125, ACTION","125, 243, CONTENT","272, 283, LOCATION","325, 328, TRIGGER","361, 381, ACTION","479, 490, CONTENT","491, 495, MODAL","495, 503, ACTION","508, 519, LOCATION","532, 549, CONTENT","554, 612, CONTENT","612, 618, MODAL","618, 623, ACTION","16, 24, ACTION","29, 38, ACTION","39, 85, CONTENT","345, 360, CONTENT","389, 439, CONTENT","445, 449, MODAL","453, 462, ACTION","464, 477, CONTENT","674, 692, LOCATION","623, 666, CONTENT"}
11238	§  Just like in the case of the abstract, it will benefit to state the novel aspects of the conducted study, only this time to position the statements before the final paragraph of the Introduction section in which the authors detail how their paper is structured subsequently.	{"50, 58, ACTION","61, 66, ACTION","66, 107, CONTENT","206, 277, CONTENT","127, 151, CONTENT","151, 205, LOCATION","32, 40, LOCATION","45, 50, MODAL","209, 214, TRIGGER","61, 66, ACTION","45, 49, MODAL","32, 40, LOCATION"}
11239	§  I have noticed that the“Materials and Methods” section that should offer abundant details regarding the research study conducted by the authors while in the same time should be concisely presenting and citing  widely known methods, is scattered across the manuscript into multiple different sections like section number 2 entitled“Background and related work” and section number 3 entitled“The generic nD SFC library”. I strongly believe that before proceeding to present the very important elements of their devised approach in the“Materials and Methods” section that must provide the precise details concerning  the authors’ conducted research in order to assure its reproducibility, a good starting point consists in unifying the above-mentioned section 2 and section 3 in the“Materials and Methods” section.	{"63, 69, MODAL","26, 49, LOCATION","69, 211, ACTION","213, 233, CONTENT","248, 302, CONTENT","235, 247, ACTION","782, 813, LOCATION","766, 775, LOCATION","752, 761, LOCATION","585, 731, CONTENT","577, 584, ACTION","392, 420, LOCATION","572, 576, MODAL","535, 566, LOCATION","367, 383, LOCATION","333, 362, LOCATION","308, 324, LOCATION","205, 211, ACTION","190, 200, ACTION","170, 176, MODAL","75, 146, CONTENT","70, 75, ACTION","63, 69, MODAL","26, 57, LOCATION"}
11240	§  When presenting the devised study that has as a final goal the development of the software library, it will be extremely helpful to design and insert a diagram depicting the main sequence of steps that one has to process in order to reproduce the results of the conducted  study. This diagram should be analyzed in detail within the manuscript by specifying all the elements needed  for each and every step, in order to reach the final result of the study, namely the software library. I consider that a suitable candidate for this diagram is Figure no. 4 from the manuscript, entitled“The abstracted class diagram for SFCLib”.	{"336, 346, LOCATION","283, 295, CONTENT","132, 281, CONTENT","124, 131, ACTION","106, 110, MODAL","3, 101, CONTENT","347, 488, CONTENT","296, 302, MODAL","568, 578, LOCATION","546, 558, LOCATION","306, 314, ACTION","588, 629, LOCATION","336, 346, LOCATION","106, 110, MODAL","8, 18, ACTION"}
11241	§  I have observed that the“Results” section, which should offer an exact and succinct analysis of the obtained results after having  performed the experiments, a clear interpretation along with clear conclusions towards the registered experimental results, exists to a certain extent scattered in several sections: in section 4 of the manuscript, entitled totally inappropriately for a scientific article“Its application on massive points dataset management”; in section 5 entitled“Experiments and discussion”. I consider that section 4 along with section 5 of the manuscript under review should be transformed  in a proper“Results” section.	{"58, 132, ACTION","27, 36, LOCATION","52, 58, MODAL","46, 51, TRIGGER","590, 596, MODAL","600, 611, ACTION","336, 346, LOCATION","624, 641, LOCATION","482, 510, LOCATION","461, 473, LOCATION","405, 459, LOCATION","27, 44, LOCATION","316, 328, LOCATION","65, 256, CONTENT","59, 64, ACTION","52, 58, MODAL","528, 537, LOCATION","549, 558, LOCATION","566, 576, LOCATION"}
11242	§  It is only after having a proper“Results” section that the authors can advance their study to an extremely important section, the“Discussion” one, in which they can finally compare the obtained experimental results, the devised software library, the overall approach to other studies that have tackled similar problems but had limitations that their paper addressed (a clear connection will be made to the Introduction section).	{"389, 393, MODAL","74, 81, ACTION","14, 35, CONTENT","69, 73, MODAL","35, 52, LOCATION","132, 144, LOCATION","176, 183, ACTION","81, 127, CONTENT","164, 167, MODAL","184, 368, CONTENT","370, 388, CONTENT","397, 401, ACTION","409, 429, LOCATION","176, 183, ACTION","153, 158, TRIGGER","35, 44, LOCATION","70, 73, MODAL"}
11243	Ø Comments regarding the "Discussion" section:	{"26, 36, LOCATION","25, 45, LOCATION"}
11244	§  The very important“Discussion” section does not exist in the manuscript under review. I consider that this section must be mandatory elaborated  in order for the authors to prove a contribution that their research has brought to the current state of knowledge. It is the“Discussion” section that offers the possibility to validate the contribution and usefulness of the conducted study from the manuscript by comparing the research design, the developed software library, the registered experimental results with the ones obtained by other valuable scientific works.	{"273, 293, LOCATION","42, 56, ACTION","21, 41, LOCATION","64, 74, LOCATION","105, 117, LOCATION","118, 122, MODAL","136, 146, ACTION","148, 263, CONTENT","325, 333, ACTION","334, 569, CONTENT","125, 146, ACTION","21, 33, LOCATION","118, 122, MODAL"}
11245	§  In the“Discussion” section it will benefit to examine, to debate the registered results and the way how they can be regarded with prospects to preceding researches that have targeted  similar goals. Unfortunately, in the current form of the manuscript under review, this discussion, this debate does not exist. The authors must address these important aspects in order to be able to pin point exactly the clear advancement that their conducted study from the manuscript has made to the current body of knowledge.	{"103, 106, TRIGGER","118, 185, ACTION","9, 21, LOCATION","33, 37, MODAL","38, 45, ACTION","326, 330, MODAL","269, 297, CONTENT","9, 29, LOCATION","61, 67, ACTION","244, 254, LOCATION","33, 37, MODAL","339, 515, CONTENT","68, 201, CONTENT","49, 56, ACTION","331, 338, ACTION","298, 312, ACTION"}
11246	§  It is in the“Discussion” section where the authors should underline both the advantages and disadvantages of their developed software library when compared with other valuable studies from the current state of art.	{"15, 35, LOCATION","61, 70, ACTION","54, 60, MODAL","71, 217, CONTENT","36, 41, TRIGGER","15, 27, LOCATION","150, 158, ACTION","54, 60, MODAL"}
11247	§  It will increase the value of the article if the authors mention in this section if they have tried other approaches before reaching  the current developed software library from the manuscript and what did the results reveal that determined them to devise the current form of their software library.	{"185, 195, LOCATION","200, 204, TRIGGER","10, 135, ACTION","20, 44, CONTENT","200, 204, TRIGGER","205, 302, CONTENT","6, 11, MODAL","11, 19, ACTION","84, 195, CONTENT","44, 48, TRIGGER","60, 67, ACTION","71, 83, LOCATION"}
11248	§  The scientific value of the conducted study will be considerably increased if the authors provide an insight regarding the feasibility of implementing the devised  software library in a real production environment, highlighting if the research can be reproduced and implemented  in a real case everyday use scenario by providing the very important implementation details.	{"3, 46, CONTENT","101, 374, CONTENT","93, 100, ACTION","78, 81, TRIGGER","67, 77, ACTION","47, 51, MODAL","47, 51, MODAL","54, 165, ACTION"}
11249	§  I consider that the manuscript will be considerably improved if the authors state clearly within the manuscript who are the potential beneficiaries of the devised  approach (proving once again the usefulness of the conducted study) and how will these potential beneficiaries be able to make use of the devised approach in their everyday activities. Are there any special constraints (material, ethical, financial or any other types) that have to be taken into account when employing the devised approach in a real case everyday use scenario?	{"34, 38, MODAL","239, 242, TRIGGER","23, 33, LOCATION","41, 165, ACTION","33, 38, MODAL","115, 234, CONTENT","104, 114, LOCATION","79, 84, ACTION","23, 33, LOCATION","243, 543, CONTENT","239, 242, TRIGGER","63, 67, TRIGGER","55, 63, ACTION"}
11250	§   In order to provide all the necessary details for assuring the reproducibility of the study, I consider that the detailed hardware and software configurations that were used when developing the software library should be specified along with the necessary hardware and software configuration that are required  in order to achieve a proper implementation in a real case everyday use scenario.	{"113, 215, CONTENT","4, 95, CONTENT","215, 221, MODAL","235, 396, CONTENT","225, 234, ACTION","173, 177, ACTION","178, 182, TRIGGER","215, 221, MODAL"}
11251	§  The manuscript will be considerable improved if the authors offer their insight within the Discussion session towards the estimated benefits that will be obtained after putting  into practice their devised software library in rapport with all the associated  implementation costs. Is the developed software library feasible from the economic point of view?	{"7, 17, LOCATION","18, 22, MODAL","25, 260, ACTION","94, 112, LOCATION","69, 82, CONTENT","7, 17, LOCATION","17, 22, MODAL","38, 47, ACTION","47, 50, TRIGGER","113, 282, CONTENT","284, 358, CONTENT","63, 68, ACTION"}
11252	§  The“Discussion” section is also a very suitable place for the authors to emphasize not only the novel aspects and strong points of their conducted study, but also to point out objectively the existing limits, possible circumstances that will hinder their software library’s effectiveness and state clear and accurate directions they will pursue in their future research activities in order to extend the current research and overcome the existing  limitations. I have noticed that within the Conclusion section the authors have partially addressed this aspect, but I consider that the statements are more suitable for the Discussion section as this restructuring of the manuscript will allow a more in-depth rationale to be provided.	{"563, 567, TRIGGER","587, 598, CONTENT","599, 616, ACTION","625, 643, LOCATION","644, 735, CONTENT","86, 463, CONTENT","76, 85, ACTION","6, 26, LOCATION","495, 513, LOCATION","295, 300, ACTION","6, 18, LOCATION","157, 160, TRIGGER","240, 244, MODAL"}
11253	§  Regarding the final statements of the“Discussion” section, it will increase the manuscript’s value if the authors make, based on the overall elaborated discussions, a clear argumentative statement regarding the procedures, the facts or processes that one must follow in order to achieve, to attain an outcome from the developed software library with maximum efficiency.	{"65, 69, MODAL","144, 154, ACTION","40, 52, LOCATION","70, 78, ACTION","102, 104, TRIGGER","96, 102, CONTENT","65, 70, MODAL","17, 60, LOCATION","123, 372, CONTENT","117, 121, ACTION"}
11254	§  Although the conclusion section is optional, I consider that the manuscript will benefit if in the Conclusion section the authors will state the most important outcome of their work. The authors should avoid simply summarizing  the aspects that they have already stated in the body of the manuscript. Instead, they should interpret their findings at a higher level of abstraction than in the Discussion section. The authors should highlight whether, or to what extent they have managed to address the necessity identified within the Introduction section. The authors should avoid restating everything  they did once again, but instead they should emphasize what their findings actually mean to the readers, therefore making the Conclusion section interesting and memorable to them.	{"577, 582, ACTION","427, 433, MODAL","335, 414, CONTENT","325, 334, ACTION","318, 324, MODAL","211, 303, CONTENT","205, 210, ACTION","198, 204, MODAL","144, 185, CONTENT","138, 143, ACTION","102, 120, LOCATION","16, 34, LOCATION","434, 443, ACTION","583, 624, CONTENT","626, 629, TRIGGER","643, 649, MODAL","650, 659, ACTION","68, 78, LOCATION","79, 83, MODAL","84, 92, ACTION","92, 94, TRIGGER","133, 138, MODAL","660, 708, CONTENT","731, 749, LOCATION","719, 726, CONTENT","750, 775, CONTENT","710, 719, TRIGGER","570, 576, MODAL","444, 557, CONTENT","16, 26, LOCATION","459, 463, TRIGGER","79, 83, MODAL","133, 143, ACTION"}
11255	§  At the end of the Conclusion, if they feel necessary, the authors can challenge the reader e.g. “One remaining aspect to reflect upon consists in …”	{"69, 72, MODAL","21, 31, LOCATION","10, 31, LOCATION","73, 82, ACTION","83, 151, CONTENT","69, 72, MODAL"}
11256	§  If the above-mentioned aspects from the review report are implemented by the authors this means that the paper will have included a very well-structured Introduction and a correctly structured abstract, therefore the authors should not repeat any part from the Introduction in the Conclusion section. The authors should not restate (like they did in the current form of the manuscript) what they have done or what the article does, they should focus instead on what they have discovered and most important on what their findings mean.	{"440, 446, MODAL","389, 433, CONTENT","284, 302, LOCATION","108, 113, LOCATION","114, 118, MODAL","124, 133, ACTION","133, 195, CONTENT","196, 204, LOCATION","205, 215, TRIGGER","461, 537, CONTENT","447, 452, ACTION","239, 245, ACTION","228, 239, MODAL","316, 326, MODAL","326, 335, ACTION","246, 276, CONTENT","114, 118, MODAL","156, 168, LOCATION","389, 393, TRIGGER","16, 25, ACTION"}
11257	§  The authors should write a short Conclusion section, in fact they should conclude in just a few sentences given the rich discussion section that they will have devised in the body of the paper. I strongly recommend the authors to overcome the temptation to repeat material from the Introduction or from the rest of the paper only to make the Conclusion longer under the false belief that a longer Conclusion section will seem more impressive.	{"15, 21, MODAL","69, 84, ACTION","36, 46, LOCATION","15, 21, MODAL","36, 54, LOCATION","69, 75, MODAL","76, 84, ACTION","85, 170, CONTENT","190, 195, LOCATION","233, 241, ACTION","241, 444, CONTENT","22, 27, ACTION"}
11258	I have reviewed the article "Investigating Effects of decoupling transport carbon emission from turnover volume in China", manuscript ID: sustainability-333839 that has been submitted for publication in the MDPI Sustainability Journal and I have identified a series of aspects that in my opinion must be addressed  in order to bring a benefit to the manuscript.	{"257, 276, CONTENT","304, 313, ACTION","296, 300, MODAL","28, 121, LOCATION","296, 300, MODAL","123, 133, LOCATION","303, 313, ACTION"}

11303	I have reviewed the manuscript "A Reallocation Approach for Software Trustworthiness Based on Trustworthy Attributes", Manuscript ID: mathematics-657731 that has been submitted for publication in the Mathematics MDPI Journal and I have identified a series of aspects that in my opinion must be addressed  in order to bring a benefit to the manuscript. In this paper, the authors propose a mathematical programming approach that is used in order to reallocate the trustworthy degree of software to its trustworthy attributes appropriately and afterwards to make the sum of the increases of all the trustworthy attribute values minimize with the requirements of software trustworthiness improvement satisfied. The authors remark that the obtained results are useful in improving software trustworthiness at reduced costs. I consider that the article will benefit if the authors take into account the following  remarks and address within the manuscript the signaled issues:	{"20, 30, LOCATION","293, 303, ACTION","286, 290, MODAL","542, 552, TRIGGER","951, 971, CONTENT","31, 117, LOCATION","286, 290, MODAL","294, 303, ACTION","247, 266, CONTENT","360, 365, LOCATION","921, 928, ACTION","940, 950, LOCATION","898, 916, CONTENT","875, 894, ACTION","861, 863, TRIGGER","853, 860, ACTION","848, 853, MODAL","19, 31, LOCATION"}
11304	General remarks about the paper. The ISO/IEC DIS 30754 International Standard, issued in 2016 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) (to which China is represented as a member by the Standardization Administration of China) approaches issues regarding Information technology, Software trustworthiness, Governance and management, Specification. According to the information provided on the website https://www.iso.org , this International Standard provides a specification for software trustworthiness. The requirements of this Standard define the overall principles for effective software trustworthiness, and include technical, physical, cultural and behavioral measures alongside effective leadership and governance. This Standard identifies the necessary tools, techniques and processes and addresses safety, reliability, availability, resilience and security issues. As the Manuscript ID: mathematics-657731 approaches issues regarding the software trustworthiness, I consider that the authors must provide precise details within their paper regarding how their reallocation approach for software trustworthiness based on trustworthy attributes helps a software product comply with the most important requirements that it must satisfy to a certain degree in order to satisfy the ISO/IEC DIS 30754 International Standard.	{"1032, 1345, CONTENT","1024, 1031, ACTION","1019, 1023, MODAL","899, 909, LOCATION","557, 563, ACTION","1019, 1023, MODAL","158, 163, TRIGGER"}
11305	Remark regarding a previous paper of the authors. The Manuscript ID: mathematics-657731 is interesting, but it still remains an aspect that must be emphasized and strengthened  more by the authors. The manuscript approaches similar problems tackled in a previous paper, written by the same research team: "Tao H.W.; Wu H.Y.; Chen Y.X. An Approach of Trustworthy Measurement Allocation Based on Sub-Attributes of Software. Math. 2019, 7, 1–15, doi: https://doi.org/10.3390/math7030237", cited as [28]. Consequently, the authors have succeeded in establishing a precedence in their line of research on the topic of Software Trustworthiness. Therefore, I consider that the manuscript under review will benefit a lot if the authors refer in the discussion section their previous paper and highlight how the timeline of their research has evolved from the findings of their previous study, to the present research results reported in the current manuscript. In this context, I would like the authors of the Manuscript ID: mathematics-657731 to highlight clearly, by writing in the paper what are the main differences between their conducted study and the previous one.	{"54, 64, LOCATION","147, 175, ACTION","140, 144, MODAL","104, 107, TRIGGER","799, 952, CONTENT","1039, 1049, ACTION","104, 107, TRIGGER","202, 212, LOCATION","306, 484, LOCATION","486, 491, ACTION","177, 196, CONTENT","728, 733, ACTION","741, 759, LOCATION","760, 780, CONTENT","1082, 1086, TRIGGER","1076, 1081, LOCATION","163, 175, ACTION","148, 158, ACTION","140, 144, MODAL","1087, 1162, CONTENT","972, 977, MODAL","785, 794, ACTION","712, 716, TRIGGER","699, 707, ACTION","670, 680, LOCATION","693, 698, MODAL","495, 499, LOCATION","795, 798, TRIGGER"}
11306	Lines 1-14, the Abstract of the paper.

11307	The sections of the manuscript. The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the Mathematics MDPI Journal's Template that provides a more logical structure that is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to express better the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review should be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5.

11308	Lines 18-30, the "Introduction" section. "Software trustworthiness is the ability of software to satisfy user expectation with its behaviors and results and to still provide continuous services by disturbances [1]. It can be characterized  by many software attributes [1–7], which are referred to as trustworthy attributes. Software trustworthiness measurement describes how to determine the trustworthy degree of software based on the given trustworthy attributes’ values and their weight values. It can provide a basis for guiding and improving  the trustworthiness of design and implementation of software. Therefore, software trustworthiness measurement becomes one of the core scientific problems in the researching on software trustworthiness [1]. Many software trustworthiness measures based on trustworthy attributes are established, including questionnaires and statistical analysis [8,9], axiomatic approaches [10–16], evidence theory [17], supervised machine learning [18], maximum entropy and grey decision-making method [19], software behaviour entropy [20], system testing [21], social-to-software framework [22], crowd wisdom [23], heuristic-systematic processing model [24], users feedback [25], STRAM (Security, Trust, Resilience, and Agility Metrics) [26], etc." I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 26 (like the authors have did) or even more scientific works in a few lines just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section. The authors must introduce a presentation of the current state of the research field by reviewing it carefully and by citing key publications. By doing so, the problem will be put into context and it will benefit the readers as well. The purpose of the literature survey is to highlight for each of the involved referenced papers the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the method used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article. This is the only way to contextualize the current state of the art in which the authors of the manuscript position their paper and address aspects that have not been tackled/solved yet by the existing studies.	{"1706, 1713, ACTION","1701, 1706, MODAL","1677, 1693, ACTION","1669, 1673, MODAL","1657, 1668, CONTENT","1481, 1499, LOCATION","1338, 1473, CONTENT","1301, 1318, ACTION","1528, 1643, CONTENT","1518, 1527, ACTION","1513, 1517, MODAL","1327, 1337, LOCATION","41, 1280, LOCATION","17, 39, LOCATION","0, 11, LOCATION","2136, 2306, CONTENT","2122, 2135, ACTION","2097, 2119, CONTENT","1736, 2096, CONTENT","0, 11, LOCATION","224, 238, ACTION","275, 280, TRIGGER","218, 221, MODAL"}
11309	The "Materials and Methods" section. In the actual form of the manuscript, the "Materials and Methods" section is missing, being partially replaced by other sections. It will benefit the paper if the authors restructure their paper and devise a proper "Materials and Methods" section, as requested by the Mathematics MDPI Journal's Template, eventually structured using subsections. In order to bring a benefit to the manuscript, the authors should state and justify very clear in the "Materials and Methods" section, preferably within the first paragraph, the choices they have made when developing the final form of their proposed approach.  The authors should state what has justified using  the given method, what is special, unexpected, or different in their approach in contrast to the existing body of knowledge. When the authors make use of a standard or usual procedure, this aspect should also be mentioned upfront, from the very beginning. I consider that the manuscript under review will benefit if the authors make all of these aspects as clear as possible to the readers starting  from the first paragraph in order to give them a clear idea of what the entire approach is about. When presenting the devised approach in the "Materials and Methods" section, it will be extremely helpful to design and insert a flowchart depicting the main sequence of steps that one has to process in order to reproduce the results of the conducted  study. This flowchart should be analyzed in detail within the manuscript by specifying all the elements needed  for each and every step, in order for one to be able to reproduce and reach the final result of the study. It will benefit the paper to specify, in the final part of the "Materials and Methods" section, details regarding the version numbers for the software and the detailed hardware configuration used within the research in order to ensure the reproducibility of the proposed approach.	{"170, 174, MODAL","584, 588, TRIGGER","63, 73, LOCATION","114, 121, ACTION","1023, 1027, ACTION","1028, 1192, CONTENT","1237, 1268, LOCATION","1467, 1473, MODAL","1477, 1485, ACTION","1486, 1495, CONTENT","1507, 1517, LOCATION","1518, 1663, CONTENT","1709, 1758, LOCATION","1693, 1700, ACTION","1760, 1944, CONTENT","418, 428, LOCATION","208, 220, ACTION","226, 231, LOCATION","236, 242, ACTION","252, 283, LOCATION","285, 381, CONTENT","442, 448, MODAL","449, 454, ACTION","459, 466, ACTION","485, 516, LOCATION","995, 999, MODAL","1000, 1007, ACTION","1008, 1010, TRIGGER","111, 121, ACTION","79, 110, LOCATION","4, 35, LOCATION","1683, 1689, LOCATION","193, 195, TRIGGER","187, 192, LOCATION","175, 182, ACTION","170, 174, MODAL","129, 165, CONTENT","540, 555, LOCATION","557, 641, CONTENT","656, 662, MODAL","663, 668, ACTION","669, 673, TRIGGER","674, 819, CONTENT","892, 898, MODAL","907, 916, ACTION","880, 891, CONTENT","1672, 1679, ACTION","1667, 1671, MODAL","1452, 1466, CONTENT","1298, 1450, CONTENT","1291, 1298, ACTION","1273, 1278, MODAL","971, 981, LOCATION","917, 949, CONTENT"}
11310	The "Discussion" section is missing. The very important "Discussion" section, recommended by the Mathematics MDPI Journal's Template, is missing. The manuscript under review will benefit if the authors devise an appropriate "Discussion" section and add it to the manuscript. In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Discussion" section (that for the time being is missing completely from the manuscript), the authors should make a comparison between their study from the manuscript and other ones that have been developed and used in the literature for the same or similar purposes. In the "Discussion" section the authors should also highlight current limitations of their study, and briefly mention some precise directions that they intend to follow in their future research work. The paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their approach and provide an insight at the end of the "Discussion" section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained results, the most important steps that one should take in order to benefit from the results of the research conducted within the manuscript.	{"948, 1146, CONTENT","898, 908, CONTENT","187, 190, TRIGGER","916, 947, LOCATION","667, 701, CONTENT","56, 76, LOCATION","150, 160, LOCATION","134, 144, ACTION","179, 186, ACTION","174, 179, MODAL","657, 666, ACTION","645, 651, MODAL","612, 632, LOCATION","451, 604, CONTENT","446, 450, ACTION","864, 885, CONTENT","842, 862, ACTION","828, 830, TRIGGER","820, 827, ACTION","815, 820, MODAL","809, 814, LOCATION","414, 424, LOCATION","383, 393, ACTION","275, 328, CONTENT","253, 255, CONTENT","249, 253, ACTION","439, 445, MODAL","337, 357, LOCATION","224, 244, LOCATION","202, 208, ACTION","715, 722, ACTION","723, 804, CONTENT","25, 35, ACTION","4, 24, LOCATION","890, 897, ACTION","28, 35, ACTION","174, 178, MODAL","5, 15, LOCATION","958, 962, TRIGGER"}
11311	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: energies-591402, having the title "A Study on the Design Method of Line Start Synchronous Reluctance Motor for Super Premium Efficiency Considering Mechanical Stress". In this paper, the authors analyze options to replace the induction motor due to its performance limitations, by analyzing the design method of line start synchronous reluctance motor considering mechanical stress.

The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to express better the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review should be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5.

11314	Lines 29-73, the "Introduction" section. In its current form, the "Introduction" section contains a series of cited papers. I do not contradict the value of these papers, or their relevance in this context, but I consider that the article under review will benefit if the authors extend this section by analyzing appropriately the cited papers and by analyzing  more other papers in order to contextualize their study. The literature review of the cited papers has been performed in the following manner: "The induction motors (IMs) account for 80% of industrial motors because of its simple structure and low manufacture cost [7-9]. However, IMs have the secondary copper loss which is typically 25% of the total loss [10]. This secondary copper loss limits the efficiency improvement of IMs. Therefore, in order to replace IMs, new types of motor are being studied to improve the efficiency [11-14]. Synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) receive the attention as the alternative to IMs because SynRM don’t have the secondary copper loss [11, 15]. Moreover, because of a greater saliency ratio, SynRM can produce a large reluctance torque when using  a variable speed drive or electronic controller [10, 16-18]. […] For this reason, line start synchronous reluctance motor (LS-SynRM) has received attention that it can operate at synchronous speed without the inverter [19-21]." (Lines 42-53). I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 15 (like the authors have did) or even more scientific works in a few lines just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section. In the "Introduction" section, the authors must introduce a presentation of the current state of the research field by reviewing it carefully and by citing other key publications. By doing so, the problem will be put into context and it will benefit the readers as well. The purpose of the literature survey is to highlight for the involved referenced papers the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the methods used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article. This is the only way to contextualize the current state of the art in which the authors of the manuscript position their paper and address aspects that have not been tackled/solved yet by the existing studies from the body of knowledge in contrast with the manuscript under review.	{"1819, 1824, MODAL","1621, 1643, LOCATION","1808, 1818, CONTENT","1594, 1612, LOCATION","1432, 1586, CONTENT","1413, 1431, ACTION","1380, 1391, LOCATION","264, 267, TRIGGER","505, 1378, LOCATION","300, 418, CONTENT","2279, 2521, CONTENT","280, 286, ACTION","66, 88, LOCATION","17, 39, LOCATION","0, 11, LOCATION","1657, 1661, MODAL","1662, 1671, ACTION","1672, 1793, CONTENT","207, 210, TRIGGER","252, 256, MODAL","256, 264, ACTION","287, 299, LOCATION","2265, 2278, LOCATION","2241, 2261, CONTENT","1885, 2239, CONTENT","1855, 1863, ACTION","1850, 1855, MODAL","1826, 1843, ACTION","0, 11, LOCATION","256, 360, ACTION","1101, 1104, MODAL","207, 210, TRIGGER"}

In the "Introduction" section, after having performed the appropriate review of the scientific articles/studies that tackle similar or related problems with the one of the manuscript, the authors must identify and state clearly in the manuscript a gap in the current state of knowledge that they intend to fill with their proposed approach. The same gap must also be tackled afterwards, in the "Discussion" section of the manuscript as well, where the authors should justify why their approach fills the identified gap in rapport with previous studies from the literature.

This flowchart will facilitate the understanding of the proposed approach and it will make the article more interesting  to the reader if used as a graphical abstract.	{"339, 343, MODAL","343, 443, ACTION","482, 490, LOCATION","339, 343, MODAL","324, 339, CONTENT","189, 322, CONTENT","37, 122, CONTENT","183, 189, ACTION","176, 182, MODAL","131, 162, LOCATION","4, 35, LOCATION","415, 490, CONTENT","409, 414, ACTION","405, 409, MODAL","354, 397, CONTENT","343, 354, ACTION"}
11318	The "Materials and Methods" section. In addition to the flowchart, in order to bring a benefit to the manuscript, the authors should state and justify very clear in the "Materials and Methods" section the choices they have made when developing the final form of their proposed approach. The authors should state what has justified using  this approach, what is special, unexpected, or different in their research methodology. It will benefit if the authors mention if they have tried other approaches that in the end led them to the current form of their research design.	{"299, 305, MODAL","306, 311, ACTION","312, 316, TRIGGER","317, 424, CONTENT","457, 464, ACTION","465, 571, CONTENT","434, 442, ACTION","429, 433, MODAL","442, 444, TRIGGER","4, 35, LOCATION","126, 132, MODAL","133, 138, ACTION","143, 150, ACTION","169, 200, LOCATION","201, 286, CONTENT","126, 138, ACTION","228, 232, TRIGGER","429, 433, MODAL","102, 112, LOCATION"}

11321	The "Results" section. In the "Results" section (which is currently missing from the manuscript), the authors should provide a concise and precise description of their obtained results and their interpretation.	{"49, 54, TRIGGER","110, 116, MODAL","68, 75, ACTION","85, 95, LOCATION","125, 210, CONTENT","55, 75, ACTION","30, 47, LOCATION","4, 21, LOCATION","117, 124, ACTION","110, 116, MODAL","49, 54, TRIGGER","85, 95, LOCATION"}
11322	The "Results" section. It will benefit the paper if the authors elaborate in this section a cost-benefit analysis regarding the implementation of their proposed solution in a daily operating environment, taking into account all the involved costs. This cost-benefit analysis is necessary in order to prove that the devised solution is feasible to be implemented on a large scale and used on a daily basis from the economic point of view, taking into consideration also the maintenance costs.	{"288, 490, CONTENT","90, 247, CONTENT","77, 89, LOCATION","4, 21, LOCATION","64, 73, ACTION","26, 30, MODAL","31, 39, ACTION","43, 49, LOCATION","49, 52, TRIGGER","248, 275, CONTENT","275, 288, ACTION","26, 30, MODAL","64, 73, ACTION"}
11323	The "Discussion" section. In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Discussion" section (which is currently missing from the manuscript), the authors should make a comparison between their approach from the manuscript and other similar ones that have been developed in the literature for the same or related purposes. There are a lot of valuable studies in the scientific literature related to the subject of the manuscript to which the authors can compare to and this comparison will highlight even more the novel aspects that their paper brought in contrast to the existing   studies.	{"5, 15, LOCATION","110, 115, TRIGGER","171, 177, MODAL","129, 136, ACTION","171, 177, MODAL","110, 115, TRIGGER","116, 136, ACTION","146, 156, LOCATION","469, 477, ACTION","338, 426, CONTENT","434, 444, LOCATION","466, 469, MODAL","183, 338, CONTENT","515, 606, CONTENT","506, 515, ACTION","500, 506, MODAL","484, 500, CONTENT","178, 182, ACTION","88, 108, LOCATION","4, 24, LOCATION"}
11324	The "Discussion" section. The authors should present the findings and their main implications in the "Discussion" section, also highlighting current limitations of their study, and briefly mention some precise directions that they intend to follow in their future research work.	{"101, 121, LOCATION","4, 24, LOCATION","53, 93, CONTENT","45, 52, ACTION","141, 175, CONTENT","128, 140, ACTION","197, 278, CONTENT","189, 196, ACTION","38, 44, MODAL","38, 52, ACTION","5, 15, LOCATION"}
11325	The "Discussion" section. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their analysis and provide an insight at the end of the "Discussion" section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained results, the most important, appropriate and concrete actions that the decisional factors and all the involved parties should take in order to benefit from the results of the research conducted within the manuscript.	{"52, 56, MODAL","5, 15, LOCATION","195, 199, TRIGGER","4, 24, LOCATION","101, 122, CONTENT","80, 99, ACTION","65, 67, TRIGGER","57, 64, ACTION","52, 56, MODAL","46, 51, LOCATION","153, 184, LOCATION","185, 459, CONTENT","135, 145, CONTENT","127, 134, ACTION"}
11326	Lines 210-230. In its actual form, the section 4 of the paper entitled "Verification" contains a lot of uninterpreted and insufficiently explained tables and figures, spreading along the pages 9-11. The authors must explain and analyze in detail all the tables and figures that have been inserted within the manuscript, it is not suitable to put the reader in the situation of interpreting, analyzing, continuing or refining the study from the manuscript under review.	{"211, 215, MODAL","86, 94, ACTION","95, 183, CONTENT","56, 61, LOCATION","308, 318, LOCATION","236, 296, CONTENT","228, 235, ACTION","216, 223, ACTION","187, 197, LOCATION","71, 86, LOCATION","39, 48, LOCATION","0, 13, LOCATION","0, 13, LOCATION","137, 146, ACTION"}
11327	Other remarks. The authors should pay more attention to the spelling , grammar and style as several errors have occurred. For example, at Line 17, the "Abstract" section, "The induction motor, which account for….", instead of "…accounts for…", or at Line 23, the "Abstract" section, "We analysis the proposed design process…" instead of "We analyze…".	{"138, 145, LOCATION","193, 198, TRIGGER","33, 68, ACTION","138, 145, LOCATION","215, 225, TRIGGER","226, 243, LOCATION","171, 213, CONTENT","250, 257, LOCATION","263, 281, LOCATION","283, 325, CONTENT","337, 350, LOCATION","27, 33, MODAL","34, 52, ACTION","53, 121, CONTENT","151, 169, LOCATION","326, 336, TRIGGER","244, 246, TRIGGER"}
11328	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: sustainability-741686, with the title "Carbon Emissions, Renewable Energy and Economic Growth in the ASEAN region". In this paper the authors analyze the dynamic causality link between carbon emissions, energy consumption, renewable energy, and economic growth in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region, making use of econometrics techniques, including the panel vector autoregressive (PVAR) and the Granger non-causality test for heterogeneity panel.  I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors address within the manuscript the following  aspects:	{"591, 614, CONTENT","533, 537, MODAL","580, 590, LOCATION","538, 545, ACTION","527, 532, LOCATION","545, 548, TRIGGER","73, 149, LOCATION","561, 568, ACTION","20, 30, LOCATION","365, 368, ACTION"}
11329	General comments regarding the manuscript.	{"31, 41, LOCATION","31, 41, LOCATION","0, 16, CONTENT"}
11330	Remark 2 - the main weak points. Firstly, taking into consideration that the manuscript under review is of type "Article", meaning a research paper that brings contributions to the current state of knowledge, I consider that the scientific soundness is an aspect that must be mandatory improved  by the authors. I consider that it is not efficient to consume monetary resources to conduct a research study, which in the end reveals aspects that consist mainly of common knowledge and universal truths, aspects that are well-known and I quote the main findings of the manuscript under review as summarized by the authors at the Lines 17-19: "Key findings reveal that carbon emissions are found to response positively to a shock of energy consumption, and negatively to a shock of renewable energy consumption and economic growth." Moreover, the same sentence could be found in an almost identical form in the "Conclusion and Policy Implications" section.	{"348, 405, CONTENT","112, 121, LOCATION","268, 272, MODAL","229, 249, CONTENT","286, 294, ACTION","627, 638, LOCATION","640, 829, LOCATION","908, 952, LOCATION","77, 87, LOCATION","331, 347, ACTION","858, 863, MODAL","867, 872, ACTION","268, 272, MODAL","407, 412, TRIGGER","189, 194, ACTION","77, 87, LOCATION"}
11331	Secondly, I consider that the authors must assume more clearly in the manuscript their original contribution by specifying this fact and by highlighting the fact that starting  from a certain point there are presented the original and novel aspects of their research. The authors must state more clearly their original methods, their original results and conclusions, the novelty of their study. In the current form of the paper, this aspect is unclear. Another weak point consists in the structure of the manuscript. If the authors make an effort to improve the structure of the manuscript and complement it with the recommendations from the specific comments, the authors will arrive at an article that can bring  a valuable insight to the current state of knowledge. Due to the devised sections, the paper is not well structured, being also difficult to follow and comprehend.	{"70, 80, LOCATION","42, 175, ACTION","674, 678, MODAL","606, 660, CONTENT","803, 808, LOCATION","430, 442, CONTENT","423, 428, LOCATION","442, 452, ACTION","674, 679, MODAL","679, 685, ACTION","685, 768, CONTENT","808, 831, ACTION","833, 878, ACTION","80, 267, CONTENT","70, 80, LOCATION","285, 290, ACTION","43, 49, ACTION","38, 42, MODAL","280, 284, MODAL","291, 395, CONTENT","533, 537, ACTION","537, 590, CONTENT","595, 605, ACTION"}
11332	Specific comments regarding the manuscript.	{"0, 17, CONTENT","32, 42, LOCATION","32, 42, LOCATION"}
11333	Remark 3 – the authorship of the manuscript. According to the information provided by the Susy platform, the Manuscript ID: sustainability-741686 has as authors Anh The Vo, Tan Ngoc Vu, Duc Hong Vo, while according to the pdf form of the manuscript, the authors are Anh The V, Tan Ngoc Vu, Duc Hong Vo. Therefore, the name of the first author is different in these two versions and the authors must address this issue.	{"33, 43, LOCATION","394, 398, MODAL","399, 406, ACTION","407, 417, CONTENT","161, 197, CONTENT","238, 248, LOCATION","266, 301, CONTENT","313, 342, CONTENT","343, 356, ACTION","394, 399, MODAL"}
11334	Remark 4 - the sections of the manuscript. In the actual form of the paper, a part of its sections is not according to the ones recommended by the template of the MDPI Sustainability Journal. The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the above-mentioned template that provides a more logical structure that is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to express better the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review should be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5. Conclusions (not mandatory), 6. Patents (not mandatory), Supplementary Materials (not mandatory), Author Contributions, Funding, Acknowledgments, Conflicts of Interest, Appendices and References.	{"255, 395, CONTENT","420, 431, LOCATION","196, 206, LOCATION","597, 607, LOCATION","90, 98, CONTENT","631, 643, ACTION","395, 413, CONTENT","233, 235, TRIGGER","225, 232, ACTION","220, 225, MODAL","99, 115, ACTION","657, 944, CONTENT","621, 627, MODAL","459, 577, CONTENT","441, 447, ACTION","431, 436, MODAL","15, 23, LOCATION","31, 41, LOCATION","116, 191, CONTENT","242, 254, ACTION","31, 41, LOCATION","128, 139, ACTION","220, 224, MODAL"}
11335	Remark 5 - the "Introduction" section. At Lines 33-34, the authors state: "It is projected that the energy demand in the region is expected to growth as much as 2.3 times (or 230 per cent) over the long-term projections to 2040." I do not contradict this information, but a proper citation is needed for this statement.	{"67, 72, ACTION","268, 271, TRIGGER","16, 28, LOCATION","290, 299, ACTION","268, 272, TRIGGER","272, 289, CONTENT","74, 229, LOCATION","42, 53, LOCATION","15, 37, LOCATION"}
11337	Remark 7 - the datasets. In what concerns the datasets, the authors state at Lines 47-48: "Seven ASEAN States over the 1990-2014 period are employed depending on the data availability." and afterwards, at Lines 66-67: " Section 4 presents data descriptions…", but these descriptions are missing.	{"28, 32, TRIGGER","68, 73, ACTION","77, 88, LOCATION","218, 258, LOCATION","264, 282, CONTENT","260, 263, TRIGGER","283, 294, ACTION","77, 88, LOCATION","90, 185, LOCATION","205, 216, LOCATION"}
11338	First of all, all data must be anchored  in time by specifying the time intervals to which the data refer to, otherwise the whole study risks to become inconsistent and irrelevant. I would like the authors to comment in the paper whether the data collected during  the period 1990-2014 are still relevant today, in 2020, in what concerns the same geographic areas. The authors should provide explanations whether their study is consistent, whether the changes that may occur within the older dataset from the above-mentioned period and the current year risk altering the final result.	{"209, 216, ACTION","23, 27, MODAL","31, 39, ACTION","41, 180, CONTENT","224, 229, LOCATION","230, 364, CONTENT","377, 383, MODAL","384, 391, ACTION","392, 584, CONTENT","183, 189, MODAL","23, 27, MODAL","30, 39, ACTION","85, 90, TRIGGER"}
11339	Secondly, the authors must provide more details regarding the preprocessing approach that they have used and the way in which they intend to solve the problems related to missing  data or abnormal values if they are to occur.	{"26, 178, ACTION","120, 125, TRIGGER","22, 26, MODAL","35, 225, CONTENT","27, 34, ACTION"}
11340	Thirdly, the authors should provide more details regarding  the datasets that will be a valuable addition to the article if they are provided  as supplementary materials to the manuscript, taking into account the fact that the "Materials and Methods" section must provide all the necessary details as to allow other researchers to verify, reproduce, discuss and extend the obtained scientific results based on the obtained published results.	{"227, 258, LOCATION","28, 35, ACTION","264, 271, ACTION","36, 187, CONTENT","272, 441, CONTENT","21, 27, MODAL","259, 263, MODAL","78, 82, MODAL","27, 58, ACTION","146, 159, LOCATION"}
11341	Remark 8 - the "Materials and Methods" section. It will benefit the manuscript if the authors include a "Materials and Methods" section (in the actual form of the manuscript this section is missing, being partially replaced by the section "3. Research methodology"), in which the new developed methods should be described  in detail while well-established methods (and information) can be briefly described and appropriately cited . The authors must restructure their manuscript in order to devise a proper "Materials and Methods" section, eventually structured in subsections. In order to bring a benefit to the manuscript, the authors should state and justify very clear in the "Materials and Methods" section, preferably within the first paragraph, the choices they have made when developing the final form of their proposed approach. The authors should state what has justified using  their approach, what is special, unexpected, or different in their research methodology. It will benefit if the authors mention if they have tried other approaches that in the end led them to the current form of their research design.	{"270, 275, TRIGGER","68, 78, LOCATION","94, 101, ACTION","51, 55, MODAL","735, 750, LOCATION","680, 711, LOCATION","654, 661, ACTION","644, 649, ACTION","868, 977, CONTENT","1009, 1016, ACTION","1017, 1123, CONTENT","67, 78, LOCATION","302, 308, MODAL","507, 538, LOCATION","468, 478, LOCATION","450, 461, ACTION","312, 321, ACTION","850, 856, MODAL","323, 332, CONTENT","751, 837, CONTENT","339, 381, CONTENT","397, 406, ACTION","425, 430, ACTION","857, 862, ACTION","993, 997, TRIGGER","986, 993, ACTION","981, 986, MODAL","661, 672, CONTENT","863, 867, TRIGGER","578, 623, CONTENT","550, 576, CONTENT","479, 507, CONTENT","445, 449, MODAL","382, 385, MODAL","276, 301, CONTENT","231, 264, LOCATION","199, 223, ACTION","187, 197, ACTION","174, 186, LOCATION","79, 81, TRIGGER","56, 63, ACTION","51, 56, MODAL","15, 46, LOCATION","637, 643, MODAL","94, 101, ACTION","104, 135, LOCATION"}
11342	Remark 9 - the "Materials and Methods" section. In order to help the readers better understand the methodology of the conducted study, in the "Materials and Methods" section, the authors should devise a flowchart that depicts the steps that they have processed in developing  their research and most important of all, the final target. This flowchart will facilitate the understanding of the proposed approach and it will make the article more interesting  to the reader if used as a graphical abstract. This diagram should be analyzed in detail within the manuscript by specifying all the elements needed  for each and every step, in order to reach the final result of the study.	{"536, 545, CONTENT","417, 421, MODAL","422, 426, ACTION","427, 502, CONTENT","201, 334, CONTENT","336, 350, CONTENT","15, 46, LOCATION","350, 355, MODAL","367, 410, CONTENT","142, 173, LOCATION","187, 193, MODAL","194, 200, ACTION","517, 523, MODAL","527, 535, ACTION","502, 516, CONTENT","568, 680, CONTENT","557, 567, LOCATION","356, 367, ACTION","48, 133, CONTENT","494, 502, LOCATION","193, 274, ACTION","351, 355, MODAL"}
11343	Remark 10 - the "Materials and Methods" section. In the "Materials and Methods" section, the authors should specify the detailed hardware and software configurations that they have used when developing  their research, in order to provide all the necessary details for assuring the reproducibility of the study.	{"107, 201, ACTION","186, 190, TRIGGER","108, 115, ACTION","116, 311, CONTENT","101, 107, MODAL","56, 87, LOCATION","16, 47, LOCATION"}
11344	Remark 11 – the equations. The equations within the manuscript should be explained , demonstrated or cited, as there are some equations that have not been introduced in the literature for the first time by the authors and that are not cited.	{"227, 240, ACTION","141, 165, ACTION","121, 135, CONTENT","27, 40, CONTENT","166, 217, CONTENT","85, 97, ACTION","101, 106, ACTION","73, 82, ACTION","63, 69, MODAL","52, 62, LOCATION","97, 100, TRIGGER","72, 82, ACTION","52, 62, LOCATION","63, 69, MODAL"}
11345	Remark 12 - the "Results" section. According to the MDPI Sustainability Journal's Template, it is recommended that a research paper contain among other sections, a "Results" one. In the actual form of the paper, this section is missing, being partially replaced by the section "4. Empirical results". In the "Results" section, the authors should provide a concise and precise description of their obtained results and their interpretation. In its actual form, the section 4 of the paper contains a series of insufficiently explained and interpreted tables and figures. The authors must explain and analyze in detail all the tables and figures that have been inserted within the manuscript, it is not appropriate to put the reader in the situation of interpreting, analyzing, continuing or refining the study from the manuscript under review.	{"339, 345, MODAL","98, 109, ACTION","464, 473, LOCATION","212, 224, LOCATION","308, 325, LOCATION","598, 605, ACTION","339, 345, MODAL","346, 353, ACTION","354, 439, CONTENT","464, 473, LOCATION","586, 593, ACTION","581, 585, MODAL","164, 173, LOCATION","225, 235, ACTION","16, 33, LOCATION","693, 711, ACTION","277, 299, LOCATION","712, 841, CONTENT","606, 688, CONTENT"}
11346	Remark 13 – Figure 1. At Lines 311-312, the authors state: "Figure 1 presents the plotted eigenvalues lying within the unit circles, implying the stability of the PVAR estimation is valid.", while in Figure 1 (presented at Lines 489-490), there are represented 5 points. Firstly, due to the fact that there are only 5 points represented within the unit circle, the authors must present the coordinates of these points, namely the values of the roots of the companion matrix. Secondly, the authors must explain in the paper why did they choose to represent in Figure 1 the unit circle with a center different from the intersection of the two represented axes, namely the origin of the coordinate plane.	{"568, 701, CONTENT","59, 189, LOCATION","25, 38, LOCATION","517, 522, LOCATION","502, 509, ACTION","497, 501, MODAL","386, 475, CONTENT","378, 385, ACTION","12, 20, LOCATION","373, 377, MODAL","223, 236, LOCATION","523, 526, TRIGGER","527, 555, CONTENT","559, 567, LOCATION","200, 208, LOCATION","52, 57, ACTION","12, 20, LOCATION"}
11347	Remark 14 - the "Discussion" section. In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Discussion" section (which is currently missing from the manuscript), the authors should make a comparison between their approach from the manuscript and other similar ones that have been developed and used in the literature for the same or related purposes. There are a lot of valuable studies in the scientific literature related to the subject of the manuscript to which the authors can compare to and this comparison will highlight even more the novel aspects that their paper has brought in contrast to the existing   studies.	{"122, 127, TRIGGER","141, 148, ACTION","183, 189, MODAL","17, 27, LOCATION","100, 120, LOCATION","16, 36, LOCATION","183, 189, MODAL","122, 128, TRIGGER","190, 194, ACTION","195, 359, CONTENT","537, 631, CONTENT","527, 536, ACTION","522, 526, MODAL","506, 521, CONTENT","491, 498, ACTION","487, 490, MODAL","360, 447, CONTENT","158, 168, LOCATION","39, 91, CONTENT","128, 148, ACTION"}
11348	Remark 15 - the "Discussion" section. The authors should present the findings and their main implications in the "Discussion" section, also highlighting current limitations of their study, and briefly mention some precise directions that they intend to follow in their future research work.	{"50, 56, MODAL","16, 36, LOCATION","57, 64, ACTION","65, 105, CONTENT","113, 133, LOCATION","201, 208, ACTION","209, 290, CONTENT","153, 187, CONTENT","140, 153, ACTION","50, 64, ACTION","17, 27, LOCATION"}

I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their analysis and provide an insight at the end of the "Discussion" section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained results, the most important, appropriate and concrete actions that the decisional factors and all the involved parties should take in order to benefit from the results of the research conducted within the manuscript as to attain the ultimate goal of sustainability.	{"64, 68, MODAL","207, 211, TRIGGER","17, 27, LOCATION","69, 76, ACTION","77, 79, TRIGGER","64, 68, MODAL","92, 111, ACTION","165, 196, LOCATION","16, 36, LOCATION","139, 146, ACTION","147, 157, CONTENT","197, 520, CONTENT","58, 63, LOCATION"}
11350	Remark 17 - the "Conclusions" section. I have noticed that the authors have chosen to entitle the last section as "Conclusion and Policy Implications" but obviously, this section depicts more than one conclusion. Therefore, the title "Conclusions" is more suitable, being also in accordance to the recommendations of the MDPI Sustainability Journal's template. In addition to this, the results should be explained and interpreted  in an appropriate "Discussion" section. It will benefit the manuscript if the authors devise a proper "Conclusions" section in which they state the most important outcome of their work. The authors should avoid simply summarizing  the aspects that they have already stated in the body of the manuscript. Instead, they should interpret their findings at a higher level of abstraction than in the Discussion section. The authors should highlight whether, or to what extent they have managed to address the necessity, the gap identified within the "Introduction" section. The authors should avoid restating everything  they did once again, but instead they should emphasize what their findings actually mean to the readers, therefore making the Conclusions section interesting and memorable to them.	{"394, 400, MODAL","404, 413, ACTION","418, 429, ACTION","449, 469, LOCATION","517, 523, ACTION","533, 554, LOCATION","555, 616, CONTENT","629, 635, MODAL","636, 641, ACTION","642, 734, CONTENT","749, 755, MODAL","151, 154, TRIGGER","98, 110, LOCATION","756, 765, ACTION","766, 845, CONTENT","858, 864, MODAL","865, 874, ACTION","875, 999, CONTENT","1107, 1227, CONTENT","1019, 1024, ACTION","1012, 1018, MODAL","1102, 1106, TRIGGER","1092, 1101, ACTION","1085, 1091, MODAL","1025, 1066, CONTENT","16, 37, LOCATION","114, 150, LOCATION","228, 247, LOCATION","248, 264, ACTION","382, 393, CONTENT","403, 429, ACTION","17, 27, LOCATION","394, 400, MODAL","151, 154, TRIGGER"}
11351	Remark 18 - the format of the paper. The authors must take into account the recommendations from the MDPI Sustainability Journal's website regarding the format of the papers, by using the Microsoft Word template or LaTeX template to prepare their manuscript. In the actual form of the paper, a part of these recommendations has not been taken into account and therefore, the reading of the manuscript is affected, for example:	{"49, 53, MODAL","178, 183, ACTION","247, 257, LOCATION","72, 258, CONTENT","324, 355, ACTION","292, 323, CONTENT","54, 71, ACTION","49, 53, MODAL"}

11608	·       I have serious concerns regarding the way how the authors of the manuscript under review have performed the literature review.  In a scientific article, an important role of the“Introduction” section is to offer authors the opportunity to analyze in detail the current state of knowledge related to the manuscript’s topic, namely the most relevant scientific works in the field in order to be able to contextualize their study and familiarize the readers with what has been done in the literature and what advancement their study aims to bring in addition to the existing body of knowledge. I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 15 (like the authors have did) or even more scientific works in a short sentence just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section.	{"50, 53, TRIGGER","73, 83, LOCATION","277, 282, ACTION","255, 597, CONTENT","621, 636, ACTION","656, 745, CONTENT","640, 655, LOCATION","185, 199, LOCATION","247, 254, ACTION"}
11609	·       I consider that the authors should perform the literature review in a manner that emphasizes for each scientific work that was cited in the text of the manuscript the contribution that was made to the existing state of art, the approach that was employed along with a short description of the most important results that have been obtained along with the existing unsolved issues of the referenced studies. By doing so, the authors will be able to better place their study in a broad body of knowledge and highlight unsolved  problems that still exist regarding the subject that their manuscript addresses.	{"36, 42, MODAL","50, 414, CONTENT","43, 50, ACTION","587, 603, LOCATION","448, 468, ACTION","439, 444, MODAL","415, 426, TRIGGER","148, 152, LOCATION","42, 217, ACTION","524, 581, CONTENT","440, 444, MODAL","514, 523, ACTION","469, 510, CONTENT"}
11610	·       The authors have cited some valuable works from the current state of art, works that are relevant to their study, but the literature review conducted within the Introduction section should be extended  as to cover a higher number of important scientific works from the literature (there are a lot of valuable open access studies in the MDPI platform that can be easily accessed ) and must be performed in a critical manner like I have explained  in the above comments.	{"122, 125, TRIGGER","68, 73, ACTION","169, 181, LOCATION","190, 196, MODAL","388, 391, TRIGGER","392, 396, MODAL","122, 125, TRIGGER","410, 430, CONTENT","399, 409, ACTION","190, 196, MODAL","125, 189, CONTENT","200, 208, ACTION"}
11611	·       Even if the authors did not perform the literature survey in an appropriate manner, they have pin pointed an exact deficiency, an unsolved problem that still exists in the current body of knowledge that their study addresses. This aspect will improve the manuscript under review on multiple plans, as the identified deficiency, the identified unsolved problem will offer great opportunities to highlight and prove in the Discussion section the contribution, the advancement that the conducted research has brought to the existing state of knowledge.	{"379, 421, CONTENT","448, 557, CONTENT","245, 250, MODAL","250, 258, ACTION","373, 378, ACTION","426, 447, LOCATION","258, 273, LOCATION","336, 367, CONTENT","368, 372, MODAL","538, 543, ACTION","263, 273, LOCATION","246, 250, MODAL"}

11614	·       When presenting the devised method, it will be extremely helpful to design and insert a diagram depicting the main sequence of steps that one has to process in order to reproduce the results of the conducted  study.

11615	·       I have observed that the“Results” section, which should offer an exact and succinct analysis of the obtained results after having  performed the experiments, a clear interpretation along with clear conclusions towards the registered experimental results, is replaced in the actual form of the manuscript, by the section entitled“3.

11631	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: symmetry-935293, with the title "Fractional Hermite–Hadamard–Fejer inequalities for a convex function with respect to an increasing function involving a positive symmetry weighted function". The authors start their research from the definition of the weighted fractional operators of a function with respect to an increasing function of a certain order and obtain a series of integral inequalities of Hermite–Hadamard–Fejer type for a convex function with respect to an increasing function involving a positive symmetry weighted function.

11634	The Main Weak Points. One of the most important aspects that must be mentioned is the fact that the authors have documented  their research but there are some issues regarding the citations. In some cases, the authors have not written the information with their own words in the manuscript under review. Therefore, in the actual form of the manuscript, some paragraphs are almost identical to ones from other papers, for example on the first page, the authors state: "Theory of convexity plays a strong role in the field of fractional integral inequalities due to the behavior of its definition. There is a strong relationship between convexity and symmetry theories. Whichever one we work on, we can apply it to the other one due the strong correlation produced between them, especially in the past few years." This sentence can be found in an almost identical form in the paper "Mohammed, P.O.; Brevik, I. A New Version of the Hermite–Hadamard Inequality for Riemann–Liouville Fractional Integrals. Symmetry 2020, 12, 610." ("The concept of convexity plays a strong role in the field of inequalities due to the behavior of its definition. There is a strong relationship between convexity and symmetry. Whichever one we work on, we can apply it to the other one due the strong correlation produced between them, especially in the past few years.") The previous published paper is not even cited in the manuscript under review at this point (the paper is only later cited firstly as [18], on Page 2, but with regard to other statements).	{"842, 1348, CONTENT","1380, 1395, ACTION","1399, 1426, LOCATION","1483, 1487, LOCATION","1492, 1498, LOCATION","1500, 1503, TRIGGER","140, 143, TRIGGER","61, 65, MODAL","68, 123, ACTION","279, 289, LOCATION","275, 302, LOCATION","61, 65, MODAL","69, 78, ACTION","82, 140, CONTENT","140, 143, TRIGGER","144, 189, CONTENT","223, 234, ACTION","235, 271, CONTENT","304, 313, TRIGGER","315, 351, LOCATION","353, 368, CONTENT","373, 389, ACTION","389, 415, CONTENT","467, 811, LOCATION","826, 829, MODAL","833, 838, ACTION","1349, 1377, CONTENT"}
11635	Moreover, due to the fact that one of the authors of the previous paper is also author of the manuscript under review, one can conclude that this author has succeeded in establishing  a precedence in his line of research. I consider that the manuscript under review will benefit a lot if the authors highlight in the "Discussion" section how their research has evolved from the findings of the previous study. The authors must highlight clearly what are the main differences between their proposed approach from the manuscript and the approach presented in the previous paper. In this context, I would like the authors of the Manuscript ID: symmetry-935293 to highlight clearly, by writing in the "Discussion" section of the paper, what are the main differences between their conducted study and the previous one.	{"732, 812, CONTENT","338, 341, TRIGGER","266, 270, MODAL","94, 104, LOCATION","126, 182, ACTION","693, 730, LOCATION","682, 689, ACTION","422, 426, MODAL","427, 444, ACTION","445, 526, CONTENT","660, 677, ACTION","626, 656, LOCATION","596, 601, MODAL","526, 530, TRIGGER","531, 575, CONTENT","0, 8, TRIGGER","285, 287, TRIGGER","300, 309, ACTION","313, 337, LOCATION","338, 408, CONTENT"}
11636	Another weak point of the Manuscript ID: symmetry-935293 consists in the structure of the manuscript. If the authors make an effort to improve the structure of the manuscript and complement it with the recommendations from the specific comments, the authors will arrive at an article that can bring  a valuable insight to the current state of knowledge.	{"175, 178, TRIGGER","135, 142, ACTION","101, 104, TRIGGER","26, 56, LOCATION","179, 189, ACTION","189, 244, CONTENT","258, 262, MODAL","262, 272, ACTION","272, 352, CONTENT","26, 36, LOCATION","292, 298, ACTION","258, 262, MODAL","143, 174, CONTENT"}
11637	Specific comments regarding the manuscript.	{"32, 42, LOCATION","28, 42, LOCATION"}
11638	Remark 1 - the sections of the manuscript. The sections of the manuscript in its actual form are not according to the ones recommended by the Symmetry MDPI Journal's Template. The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the above-mentioned template that provides a more logical structure that is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to better express the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review should be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5. Conclusions (not mandatory), 6. Patents (not mandatory), Supplementary Materials (not mandatory), Author Contributions, Funding, Acknowledgments, Conflicts of Interest, Appendices and References.	{"176, 203, LOCATION","204, 208, MODAL","217, 219, TRIGGER","220, 378, CONTENT","380, 416, CONTENT","416, 420, MODAL","426, 430, ACTION","446, 460, ACTION","461, 561, CONTENT","563, 575, TRIGGER","577, 604, LOCATION","605, 611, MODAL","615, 627, ACTION","641, 929, CONTENT","31, 41, LOCATION","11, 41, LOCATION","123, 134, ACTION","204, 208, MODAL","44, 73, LOCATION"}
11639	Remark 2 - Lines 1-7, the "Abstract" of the paper. In the "Abstract" of the paper, the authors must present in a clearer manner the following  aspects: the background, the methods, the main findings, the conclusions, as in the actual form of the manuscript, the abstract offers information related only to some of these aspects and even so, their delimitation is unclear. In the "Abstract" of the paper, along with the above-mentioned elements, the authors should briefly state the novelty of their proposed approach.	{"95, 99, MODAL","11, 20, LOCATION","11, 20, LOCATION","99, 141, ACTION","457, 463, MODAL","108, 371, CONTENT","379, 389, LOCATION","457, 463, MODAL","464, 477, ACTION","477, 516, CONTENT","57, 69, LOCATION","26, 36, LOCATION","99, 107, ACTION"}
11640	Remark 3 - Lines 10-22, the "Introduction" section. In its current form, the "Introduction" section contains 30 cited papers. I do not contradict the value of these papers, or their relevance in this context, but I consider that the article under review will benefit if the authors improve this section. I consider that the literature review should be enhanced by performing a careful analysis of the cited  works. The authors must highlight exactly, for the involved referenced papers the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the methods used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article. This is the only way to contextualize the current state of the art in which the authors of the manuscript position their paper, identify, and address aspects that have not been tackled/solved yet by the existing studies.	{"11, 22, LOCATION","28, 43, LOCATION","77, 92, LOCATION","209, 212, TRIGGER","254, 258, MODAL","259, 266, ACTION","267, 269, TRIGGER","270, 302, CONTENT","320, 341, CONTENT","341, 348, MODAL","352, 360, ACTION","361, 413, CONTENT","427, 431, MODAL","432, 449, ACTION","486, 753, CONTENT","824, 829, TRIGGER","860, 868, ACTION","869, 880, CONTENT","882, 890, ACTION","896, 903, ACTION","904, 973, CONTENT","209, 212, TRIGGER","254, 258, MODAL","351, 406, ACTION","11, 22, LOCATION"}
11641	Remark 4 - the gap in the scientific literature. After having performed a critical survey of what has been done up to this point in the scientific literature, the authors must identify and state more clearly in the paper a gap in the current state of knowledge that needs to be filled, a gap that is being addressed by their manuscript. This gap must also be used afterwards, in the "Discussion" section of the manuscript as well, where the authors should justify why their approach fills the identified gap in rapport with previous studies from the literature.	{"189, 194, ACTION","325, 335, LOCATION","189, 207, ACTION","93, 97, TRIGGER","171, 175, MODAL","359, 363, ACTION","11, 47, CONTENT","449, 455, MODAL","431, 436, TRIGGER","221, 335, CONTENT","407, 421, LOCATION","383, 395, LOCATION","337, 345, CONTENT","346, 350, MODAL","170, 175, MODAL","176, 184, ACTION","455, 463, ACTION","464, 560, CONTENT","211, 220, LOCATION"}
11642	Remark 5 - other issues regarding the "Introduction". In the "Introduction" section the authors must also declare the novel aspects of their work. After declaring the novel aspects of their work, at the end of the "Introduction" section, the authors should present the structure of their paper, under the form: "The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 contains…".	{"113, 145, CONTENT","106, 113, ACTION","96, 100, MODAL","61, 75, LOCATION","37, 52, LOCATION","250, 256, MODAL","199, 236, LOCATION","265, 380, CONTENT","256, 264, ACTION","39, 51, LOCATION","250, 264, ACTION","96, 100, MODAL"}
11643	Remark 6 - the "Materials and Methods" section. It will benefit the paper if the authors restructure their paper and devise a "Materials and methods" section (eventually structured in subsections), in which the new developed methods are described in detail while well-established methods (and information) are briefly described and appropriately cited. I consider that the authors must pay more attention to the appropriate citation of the methods and results that have been retrieved from the scientific literature. When the authors present the information in the "Materials and Methods" section, they must assume clearly their original contribution by specifying this fact and by highlighting the fact that starting from a certain point there are depicted the original and novel aspects of their research in contrast to the already existing  ones from the literature.	{"201, 206, TRIGGER","207, 232, CONTENT","237, 246, ACTION","51, 55, MODAL","638, 650, LOCATION","257, 262, TRIGGER","332, 351, ACTION","310, 327, ACTION","263, 305, CONTENT","237, 256, ACTION","603, 607, MODAL","534, 557, CONTENT","564, 588, LOCATION","623, 869, CONTENT","607, 622, ACTION","517, 521, TRIGGER","408, 515, CONTENT","386, 404, ACTION","381, 385, MODAL","201, 206, TRIGGER","74, 76, TRIGGER","126, 149, LOCATION","159, 195, CONTENT","117, 123, ACTION","101, 112, LOCATION","89, 100, ACTION","14, 38, LOCATION"}
11644	Remark 7 - the "Materials and Methods" section. When presenting the devised approach in this section, it will be extremely helpful to design and insert a flowchart depicting the main sequence of steps that one has to process in order to reproduce the results of the conducted  study. This flowchart should be analyzed in detail within the manuscript by specifying all the elements needed  for each and every step, in order for one to be able to reproduce and reach the final result of the study.	{"299, 305, MODAL","48, 52, TRIGGER","53, 100, CONTENT","105, 109, MODAL","309, 317, ACTION","113, 130, ACTION","134, 140, ACTION","145, 151, ACTION","152, 282, CONTENT","15, 38, LOCATION","105, 109, MODAL","328, 349, LOCATION","53, 63, ACTION","352, 363, ACTION","48, 52, TRIGGER","350, 352, TRIGGER","339, 349, LOCATION","363, 495, CONTENT"}
11645	Remark 8 - the equations within the manuscript. All the equations within the manuscript should be explained , demonstrated or cited, as there are some equations that have not been introduced in the literature for the first time by the authors and that are not cited.	{"97, 131, ACTION","36, 46, LOCATION","97, 107, ACTION","88, 94, MODAL","48, 87, LOCATION","136, 160, CONTENT","171, 190, ACTION","191, 208, LOCATION","88, 94, MODAL","243, 246, TRIGGER","256, 265, ACTION","32, 46, LOCATION","11, 24, LOCATION"}
11646	Remark 9 - the "Discussion" section. In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Discussion" section (which is currently missing from the manuscript), the authors should make a comparison between their study from the manuscript and other ones that have been developed and used in the literature for the same or similar purposes. There are a lot of valuable studies in the scientific literature related to the subject of the manuscript to which the authors can compare to and this comparison will highlight even more the insights that their paper has brought in contrast to the existing   studies. This comparison is mandatory in order to highlight the clear contribution to the current state of knowledge that the authors have brought.	{"657, 666, ACTION","206, 346, CONTENT","189, 206, ACTION","182, 188, MODAL","121, 126, TRIGGER","98, 112, LOCATION","15, 27, LOCATION","515, 524, ACTION","510, 514, MODAL","635, 644, ACTION","525, 614, CONTENT","645, 653, TRIGGER","494, 509, CONTENT","616, 631, CONTENT","667, 754, CONTENT","490, 493, TRIGGER","479, 489, ACTION","475, 478, MODAL","457, 462, TRIGGER","154, 167, LOCATION","121, 126, TRIGGER","182, 188, MODAL","140, 147, ACTION","16, 26, LOCATION","129, 147, ACTION"}
11647	Remark 10 - the "Discussion" section. In the "Discussion" section, the authors should also highlight current limitations of their study and briefly mention some precise directions that they intend to follow in their future research work.	{"17, 27, LOCATION","79, 85, MODAL","148, 155, ACTION","79, 85, MODAL","45, 57, LOCATION","16, 29, LOCATION","91, 100, ACTION","100, 135, CONTENT","156, 236, CONTENT","140, 155, ACTION"}
11648	Remark 11 - the "Discussion " section. The paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their approach and provide an insight at the end of the "Discussion" section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained results, the most important benefits of the research conducted within the manuscript, taking also into account its practical applicability.	{"62, 64, TRIGGER","124, 131, ACTION","161, 173, LOCATION","182, 191, ACTION","192, 196, TRIGGER","131, 153, CONTENT","49, 53, MODAL","16, 29, LOCATION","197, 379, CONTENT","192, 196, TRIGGER","49, 53, MODAL","17, 27, LOCATION"}
11649	Remark 12 - the "Discussion" section. The authors should highlight whether, or to what extent they have managed to address the necessity identified within the "Introduction" section. In this section the authors must present in a clearer manner the learnings and insights of their research.	{"211, 223, ACTION","82, 86, TRIGGER","17, 27, LOCATION","50, 56, MODAL","87, 93, ACTION","16, 28, LOCATION","82, 86, TRIGGER","244, 288, CONTENT","67, 74, TRIGGER","215, 223, ACTION","57, 66, ACTION","49, 56, MODAL","211, 215, MODAL","94, 181, CONTENT"}
11650	Remark 13 - the "Conclusions" section. It will benefit the manuscript if the authors devise a proper "Conclusions" section in which they state the most important outcome of their work. The authors should avoid simply summarizing  the aspects that they have already stated in the body of the manuscript. Instead, they should interpret their findings at a higher level of abstraction than in the "Discussion" section (section that is missing from the manuscript like I have mentioned above). The authors should highlight whether, or to what extent they have managed to address the target proposed within the "Introduction" section. The authors should avoid restating everything  they did once again, but instead they should emphasize what their findings actually mean to the readers, therefore making the "Conclusions" section interesting and memorable to them.	{"317, 323, MODAL","323, 333, ACTION","333, 381, CONTENT","394, 406, LOCATION","416, 423, CONTENT","429, 439, ACTION","445, 459, LOCATION","502, 508, MODAL","509, 518, ACTION","518, 526, TRIGGER","534, 538, TRIGGER","539, 594, CONTENT","605, 620, LOCATION","642, 648, MODAL","649, 654, ACTION","654, 696, CONTENT","698, 701, TRIGGER","702, 709, TRIGGER","715, 721, MODAL","722, 731, ACTION","732, 859, CONTENT","204, 209, ACTION","16, 29, LOCATION","70, 72, TRIGGER","42, 46, MODAL","85, 91, ACTION","92, 122, CONTENT","126, 131, TRIGGER","137, 142, ACTION","55, 69, LOCATION","59, 69, LOCATION","137, 142, ACTION","143, 183, CONTENT","197, 203, MODAL","42, 46, MODAL","209, 271, CONTENT","126, 131, TRIGGER","275, 301, LOCATION","303, 310, TRIGGER"}
11651	Remark 14 - the explanations within the paper. The paper contains a lot of insufficiently explained and interpreted computations, for example the ones from Pages 3-13. The authors must take into account that this is a scientific article that should contain not only mathematical formalism (which indeed is of paramount importance), but also detailed explanations. Therefore, the authors must explain and analyze in detail all the results that have been inserted within the manuscript as equations, because it is not suitable to put the reader in the situation of interpreting, analyzing, continuing or refining the study from the manuscript under review.	{"208, 236, CONTENT","626, 654, LOCATION","156, 166, LOCATION","90, 99, ACTION","180, 184, MODAL","290, 295, TRIGGER","12, 45, LOCATION","47, 56, LOCATION","57, 65, ACTION","66, 128, CONTENT","156, 166, LOCATION","179, 184, MODAL","184, 203, ACTION","242, 248, MODAL","249, 256, ACTION","257, 330, CONTENT","332, 335, TRIGGER","336, 362, CONTENT","363, 373, TRIGGER","387, 391, MODAL","392, 399, ACTION","404, 411, ACTION","411, 496, CONTENT","498, 505, TRIGGER"}

11653	Remarks regarding the format of the paper. In addition to the above-mentioned issues, the authors must perform a thorough editing  of their manuscript in order to achieve a proper readable paper. The authors must take into account the recommendations from the MDPI Symmetry Journal website regarding  the format of the papers ( https://www.mdpi.com/journal/symmetry/instructions ), by using the Microsoft Word template or LaTeX template to prepare their manuscript. In the actual form of the paper, most of these recommendations have not been taken into account. Therefore, the reading of the manuscript is affected. Please correct this aspect according to the Journal's Template.	{"589, 603, LOCATION","624, 631, ACTION","563, 572, TRIGGER","534, 548, ACTION","499, 528, CONTENT","231, 464, CONTENT","213, 230, ACTION","208, 212, MODAL","111, 194, CONTENT","98, 103, MODAL","18, 41, LOCATION","632, 680, CONTENT","68, 77, ACTION","103, 110, ACTION","140, 150, LOCATION"}
11654	I have reviewed the manuscript "Generating future-oriented energy policies and technologies from the multidisciplinary group discussions by text-mining-based identification of topics and experts", Manuscript ID: sustainability-371652 that has been submitted for publication in the MDPI Sustainability Journal and I have identified a series of aspects that in my opinion must be addressed  in order to bring a benefit to the manuscript:	{"119, 124, ACTION","197, 233, LOCATION","20, 30, LOCATION","378, 387, ACTION","370, 374, MODAL","331, 350, CONTENT","320, 330, ACTION","30, 195, LOCATION","16, 30, LOCATION","370, 374, MODAL"}
11655	In this paper, the authors propose a systematic approach for agenda-setting and policy-making in future-oriented and multidisciplinary perspectives. The authors apply text-mining techniques to design multidisciplinary group discussions and generate energy policies and technologies (EP&Ts) for the future society from the multidisciplinary perspectives. The authors apply their proposed method to South Korea, by identifying the core energy-specific future trends and the top-priority future-oriented EP&Ts for this country.	{"167, 171, LOCATION","218, 223, ACTION","3, 13, LOCATION"}
11656	I consider that the article will benefit if the authors take into account the following  remarks and address within the manuscript the signaled issues:	{"41, 43, TRIGGER","120, 130, LOCATION","32, 87, ACTION","16, 27, LOCATION","56, 73, ACTION","74, 96, CONTENT","101, 108, ACTION","108, 150, CONTENT","109, 130, LOCATION","28, 32, MODAL"}

Lessons learned from application, 6. Conclusion, Acknowledgements and References. According to the Sustainability MDPI Journal's Template, it is recommended that a research paper contain the following sections: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5. Conclusions (not mandatory), 6. Patents (not mandatory), Supplementary Materials (not mandatory), Author Contributions, Funding, Acknowledgments, Conflicts of Interest, Appendices and References.

11663	·       In the actual form of the manuscript, after the Introduction, there exists a section entitled "2. Literature review". I consider that this section's purpose and the one of the Introduction are overlapping and therefore I consider that the two sections should be concatenated and reorganized , into a single section, namely the "Introduction" (if they consider necessary, the authors can use subsections). The actual Lines 90-94 from the actual Introduction section should be placed  at the final part of the new Introduction section, after the actual "2. Literature review" section is restructured in the Introduction.	{"102, 124, LOCATION","424, 435, LOCATION","301, 411, CONTENT","287, 298, ACTION","270, 282, ACTION","260, 266, MODAL","243, 259, CONTENT","216, 226, TRIGGER","201, 212, ACTION","142, 196, CONTENT","473, 479, MODAL","46, 68, LOCATION","260, 266, MODAL","269, 298, ACTION","34, 44, LOCATION","11, 44, LOCATION","606, 625, CONTENT","593, 605, ACTION","559, 581, LOCATION","542, 547, TRIGGER","491, 540, CONTENT","483, 489, ACTION"}
11664	·       In the "2. Literature review" section the authors have introduced a presentation of the current state of the research field by reviewing it carefully and by citing key publications. By doing so, the problem has been put into context and the main purpose of the literature survey has been achieved: to highlight exactly, for each of the involved referenced papers the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the method used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article. In this way, the authors of the paper under review have managed to contextualize the current state of the art in which they position their paper and address aspects that have not been tackled/solved yet by the existing studies.	{"749, 756, TRIGGER","15, 37, LOCATION","380, 392, LOCATION","104, 109, ACTION","751, 756, TRIGGER","666, 688, LOCATION","771, 782, LOCATION","190, 201, TRIGGER"}

The authors must explain and analyze in detail all the tables and figures that have been inserted within the manuscript, it is not suitable to put the reader in the situation of interpreting, analyzing, continuing or refining the study from the manuscript under review.	{"0, 10, LOCATION","397, 424, LOCATION","14, 22, LOCATION","28, 37, LOCATION","168, 172, MODAL","173, 180, ACTION","185, 192, ACTION","193, 275, CONTENT","4, 10, LOCATION","126, 135, ACTION"}
11704	The "Results and Discussion" section. In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Results and Discussion" section, the authors should make a comparison between their study from the manuscript and other ones that have been developed and used in the literature for the same or similar purposes. In the "Results and Discussion" section the authors should also highlight current limitations of their study, and briefly mention some precise directions that they intend to follow in their future research work. The paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their approach and provide an insight at the end of the "Results and Discussion" section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained results, the most important steps that one should take in order to benefit from the results of the research conducted within the manuscript. The authors should highlight within the manuscript the way in which their approach can represent a step towards obtaining  an improved functionality of a real wind turbine.	{"907, 928, LOCATION","386, 420, CONTENT","928, 1050, CONTENT","376, 385, ACTION","364, 370, MODAL","319, 343, LOCATION","609, 616, ACTION","171, 310, CONTENT","153, 170, ACTION","146, 152, MODAL","100, 124, LOCATION","617, 627, CONTENT","631, 678, LOCATION","678, 770, CONTENT","780, 786, MODAL","786, 791, ACTION","442, 522, CONTENT","890, 896, MODAL","689, 693, TRIGGER","146, 152, MODAL","255, 259, ACTION","17, 27, LOCATION","804, 811, ACTION","791, 800, TRIGGER","4, 28, LOCATION","425, 441, ACTION","812, 876, CONTENT","897, 906, ACTION"}

11708	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: symmetry-470531, with the title "Anomaly Detection Based on Mining Six Local Data Features and BP Neural Network ". In this paper, the authors develop an anomaly detection model based on mining six local data features as the input of BP neural network. The authors state that the six mined local data features can describe the local monotonicity, convexity/concavity, the local inflection property and peaks distribution of the key performance indicators (KPIs) data.	{"67, 149, LOCATION","300, 305, ACTION","20, 30, LOCATION","20, 50, LOCATION"}

11710	Ø  First of all, I consider that the authors must assume more clearly in the paper their original contribution by specifying this fact and by highlighting the fact that starting from a certain point there are presented the original and novel aspects of their research. The authors must state more clearly their original methods, their original results and conclusions, the novelty of their study. In the current form of the paper, this aspect is unclear.	{"286, 304, ACTION","281, 286, MODAL","155, 268, CONTENT","141, 154, ACTION","124, 134, CONTENT","114, 124, ACTION","83, 111, CONTENT","73, 82, LOCATION","49, 70, ACTION","45, 49, MODAL","45, 49, MODAL","114, 124, ACTION","304, 395, CONTENT"}
11711	Ø  The sections of the manuscript in its actual form are not according to the ones recommended by the Symmetry MDPI Journal's Template. The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the above-mentioned template that provides a more logical structure that is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to better express the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review should be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5. Conclusions (not mandatory), 6. Patents (not mandatory), Supplementary Materials (not mandatory), Author Contributions, Funding, Acknowledgments, Conflicts of Interest, Appendices and References.	{"564, 571, MODAL","3, 33, LOCATION","57, 73, ACTION","74, 134, CONTENT","186, 198, ACTION","199, 338, CONTENT","340, 357, CONTENT","23, 33, LOCATION","83, 94, ACTION","164, 168, MODAL","361, 375, LOCATION","376, 380, MODAL","386, 390, ACTION","403, 420, ACTION","420, 521, CONTENT","523, 535, TRIGGER","537, 564, LOCATION","575, 587, ACTION","600, 889, CONTENT","177, 179, TRIGGER","164, 168, MODAL"}
11712	Ø  Lines 22-28, the "Introduction" section: "Key performance indicators (KPIs) are time series data with the format of (timestamp, value), which can be collected  these data from network traces, syslogs, web access logs, SNMP and other data sources [1], Figure.1 shows some types of KPIs. Anomaly detection [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] is proposed to find“the variation”, as so called the anomaly, from the norm data set. In recent years, anomaly detection plays an increasingly important role in some big data analysis areas, such as financials [8], cyber-security [9] and so on. A rich body of literature exists on detecting KPIs anomalies, see for example [1-14]." I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 14 (like the authors have did) or even more scientific works in a few lines just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section. In this section, the authors must introduce a presentation of the current state of the research field by reviewing it carefully and by citing key publications. By doing so, the problem will be put into context and it will benefit the readers as well. The purpose of the literature survey is to highlight for each of the involved referenced papers the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the method used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article. This is the only way to contextualize the current state of the art in which the authors of the manuscript position their paper and address aspects that have not been tackled/solved yet by the existing studies.	{"718, 723, ACTION","724, 877, CONTENT","880, 893, LOCATION","906, 911, MODAL","912, 921, ACTION","922, 979, CONTENT","980, 982, TRIGGER","983, 992, ACTION","1013, 1019, ACTION","1020, 1036, CONTENT","992, 995, CONTENT","139, 144, TRIGGER","1063, 1067, MODAL","1071, 1074, ACTION","1075, 1087, CONTENT","145, 148, MODAL","679, 695, ACTION","44, 657, LOCATION","20, 34, LOCATION","1095, 1099, MODAL","1100, 1107, ACTION","1108, 1127, CONTENT","1129, 1165, CONTENT","1172, 1181, ACTION","1182, 1491, CONTENT","1562, 1567, TRIGGER","1598, 1606, ACTION","1607, 1618, CONTENT","1623, 1630, ACTION","1632, 1700, CONTENT","3, 14, LOCATION","151, 161, ACTION","2, 14, LOCATION","699, 714, LOCATION"}
11713	Ø  Lines 72-76, the "Introduction" section: In the "Introduction" section, the authors must specify clearly the gap in the current state of knowledge that they intend to fill with their proposed approach. The same gap must also be tackled afterwards, in the "Discussion" section of the manuscript (which is currently missing from the manuscript) as well, where the authors should justify why their approach fills the identified gap in rapport with previous studies from the literature.	{"355, 360, TRIGGER","3, 14, LOCATION","19, 34, LOCATION","51, 65, LOCATION","87, 91, MODAL","92, 107, ACTION","108, 203, CONTENT","205, 217, CONTENT","218, 222, MODAL","231, 238, ACTION","239, 249, CONTENT","257, 271, LOCATION","282, 297, LOCATION","298, 303, TRIGGER","307, 324, ACTION","330, 344, LOCATION","373, 379, MODAL","380, 387, ACTION","387, 484, CONTENT","3, 14, LOCATION","87, 99, ACTION","87, 91, MODAL","239, 249, TRIGGER"}
11714	Ø  The "Materials and Methods" section: In order to help the readers better understand the methodology of the conducted study, in the "Materials and Methods" section (which is currently missing from the manuscript) the authors should devise a flowchart that depicts the steps that they have processed in developing  their research and most important of all, the final target.

11716	Ø  The "Discussion" section: In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Discussion" section (which is currently missing from the manuscript), the authors should make a comparison between their approach from the manuscript and other similar ones that have been developed in the literature for the same or related purposes. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their analysis and provide an insight at the end of the "Discussion" section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained results, the most important, appropriate and concrete actions that the decisional factors and all the involved parties should take in order to benefit from the results of the research conducted within the manuscript.	{"567, 775, CONTENT","511, 515, TRIGGER","113, 118, TRIGGER","174, 180, MODAL","132, 139, ACTION","8, 18, LOCATION","381, 383, TRIGGER","443, 450, ACTION","465, 500, LOCATION","451, 461, CONTENT","113, 118, TRIGGER","122, 139, ACTION","146, 159, LOCATION","174, 180, MODAL","180, 186, ACTION","186, 340, CONTENT","368, 373, MODAL","6, 19, LOCATION","91, 104, LOCATION","373, 380, ACTION","520, 529, ACTION"}

11718	Ø  The paper contains a lot of insufficiently explained and interpreted figures and tables (for example, Figure 4 covers 2 pages and it is commented within a single sentence, under the form: "Figure. 4 shows the numerical results of the six features mined of some KPIs", while Figure 5 covers one page and is commented under the form: "Figure 5 shows the numerical results."). The authors must explain and analyze in detail all the figures and tables that have been inserted within the manuscript, it is not suitable to put the reader in the situation of interpreting, analyzing, continuing or refining the study from the manuscript under review.	{"72, 90, LOCATION","72, 79, LOCATION","517, 646, CONTENT","504, 516, ACTION","475, 496, LOCATION","46, 55, ACTION","414, 474, CONTENT","406, 413, ACTION","394, 401, ACTION","389, 394, MODAL","335, 374, LOCATION","277, 285, LOCATION","271, 276, TRIGGER","190, 269, LOCATION","105, 113, LOCATION","3, 12, LOCATION"}
11719	Ø  The "Conclusions" section. I consider that the results are insufficiently explained and interpreted by the current form of the "Conclusions" section. It will benefit the manuscript if the authors devise a proper "Conclusions" section in which they state the most important outcome of their work. The authors should avoid simply summarizing  the aspects that they have already stated in the body of the manuscript. Instead, they should interpret their findings at a higher level of abstraction than in the Discussion section. The authors should highlight whether, or to what extent they have managed to address the necessity identified within the Introduction section. The authors should avoid restating everything  they did once again, but instead they should emphasize what their findings actually mean to the readers, therefore making the Conclusions section interesting and memorable to them.	{"695, 737, CONTENT","183, 186, TRIGGER","156, 160, MODAL","7, 20, LOCATION","129, 144, LOCATION","46, 57, CONTENT","198, 205, ACTION","214, 228, LOCATION","240, 245, TRIGGER","251, 256, ACTION","257, 297, CONTENT","311, 317, MODAL","318, 324, ACTION","324, 386, CONTENT","389, 415, LOCATION","417, 424, TRIGGER","431, 437, MODAL","437, 447, ACTION","447, 527, CONTENT","540, 546, MODAL","547, 556, ACTION","557, 564, TRIGGER","571, 576, TRIGGER","577, 583, ACTION","584, 637, CONTENT","645, 669, LOCATION","683, 689, MODAL","690, 695, ACTION","738, 742, TRIGGER","756, 762, MODAL","763, 772, ACTION","773, 821, CONTENT","823, 832, TRIGGER","832, 839, ACTION","841, 897, CONTENT","240, 245, TRIGGER","156, 160, MODAL","77, 86, ACTION","173, 183, LOCATION"}

Please address this issue either by citing these papers in the manuscript if they have been used in documenting the paper, or by deleting them in the opposite case.	{"150, 162, CONTENT","142, 149, ACTION","166, 180, LOCATION","199, 203, ACTION","88, 98, LOCATION","3, 18, LOCATION","20, 24, LOCATION","25, 30, LOCATION","114, 121, ACTION","84, 98, LOCATION","40, 53, LOCATION","140, 142, TRIGGER","246, 270, CONTENT","235, 244, ACTION","230, 232, TRIGGER","122, 132, CONTENT"}
11721	I have reviewed the article "Innovative system for heat recovery and combustion gas cleaning", Manuscript ID: energies-615811 that has been submitted for publication in MDPI Energies Journal. In this paper, the authors propose a solution designed to increase the efficiency of fuel conversion by heating up substrates of combustion processes, to recover heat combustion gases as a result of their cooling and water vapor condensation, therefore reducing the  pollution level. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors address within the manuscript the following  aspects:	{"561, 582, CONTENT","538, 559, LOCATION","530, 537, ACTION","515, 517, TRIGGER","501, 506, MODAL","95, 125, LOCATION","27, 93, LOCATION","95, 105, LOCATION","435, 444, TRIGGER","506, 573, ACTION"}
11722	Lines 16-65, the "Introduction" section. In its current form, the "Introduction" section contains a series of cited papers. I do not contradict the value of these papers, or their relevance in this context, but I consider that the article under review will benefit if the authors extend this section by analyzing appropriately the cited papers and by analyzing  more other papers in order to contextualize their study. The literature review of the cited papers has been performed in the following manner: "A significant part of these systems in the EU, and most of them in Poland, are extremely worn-out [1–3]. They are not efficient and produce considerable amounts of impurities and pollutants which have a negative effect on the environment [4,5]. […] They do not reduce emission of pollutants generated by technological systems of heat sources [6,7]. […] Solutions with recuperators can include devices installed as separate elements of the technological system of the heat source [8–11] or devices which constitute an integral part of the combustion chamber, e.g., in condensing boilers [11,12]. Recently, systems with compressor or sorption heat pumps for the recovery and reuse of waste heat have been used most frequently [13,14]. An interesting concept of using an adsorption heat pump for reusing the heat generated by a district heating system in the summer period, when the heat is treated as waste heat, was discussed in [15]. However, the solutions for heat recovery with the use of recuperators and/or heat pumps do not in any way affect changes in the combustion gas composition, thus they do not contribute to the reduction of environmental burden caused by heat sources. This is a serious disadvantage of these solutions in comparison to the installation described herein, which enhances energy efficiency of boilers and reduces emission of pollutants and impurities, including solid impurities. Methods of improving control systems in heating boilers are also often applied in order to enhance energy efficiency of heat sources [16–19]. […] This has a negative effect on the costs and time required for the modernization of control systems [20–22]." (Lines 17-42). I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 22 (like the authors have did) or even more scientific works in a half of a page just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section. In the "Introduction" section, the authors must introduce a presentation of the current state of the research field by reviewing it carefully and by citing other key publications. By doing so, the problem will be put into context and it will benefit the readers as well. The purpose of the literature survey is to highlight for the involved referenced papers the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the methods used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article. This is the only way to contextualize the current state of the art in which the authors of the manuscript position their paper and address aspects that have not been tackled/solved yet by the existing studies from the body of knowledge in contrast with the manuscript under review.	{"17, 31, LOCATION","2621, 2625, ACTION","2626, 2638, CONTENT","2646, 2650, MODAL","2651, 2658, ACTION","2659, 2678, CONTENT","3106, 3111, TRIGGER","3111, 3141, CONTENT","3142, 3150, ACTION","3151, 3162, CONTENT","3167, 3174, ACTION","3174, 3317, CONTENT","2538, 2540, CONTENT","0, 11, LOCATION","2565, 2587, CONTENT","2602, 2613, CONTENT","2614, 2618, MODAL","300, 417, CONTENT","2452, 2456, MODAL","2225, 2240, LOCATION","252, 256, MODAL","2416, 2430, LOCATION","2170, 2181, LOCATION","505, 2168, LOCATION","2457, 2466, ACTION","227, 251, LOCATION","206, 210, TRIGGER","66, 80, LOCATION","2466, 2524, CONTENT","2525, 2527, TRIGGER","2527, 2537, ACTION","2558, 2564, ACTION","207, 210, TRIGGER","2452, 2456, MODAL","256, 360, ACTION","0, 11, LOCATION","286, 299, LOCATION","279, 286, ACTION","264, 267, TRIGGER"}
11723	Lines 29-73, the "Introduction" section. In the "Introduction" section, after having performed the appropriate review of the scientific articles/studies that tackle similar or related problems with the one of the manuscript, the authors must identify and state clearly in the manuscript a gap in the current state of knowledge that they intend to fill with their proposed approach. The same gap must also be tackled afterwards, in the "Results and Discussion" section of the manuscript as well, where the authors should justify why their approach fills the identified gap in rapport with previous studies from the literature.

11725	At Lines 212-214, in the "Materials and methods" section, the authors state: "Further tests of the installation presented in the paper have been planned under a new research and implementation project. However, the project has not been implemented yet due to lack of funding." Afterwards, at Lines 303-304, in the "Conclusions" section, the authors state: "Financial analyses, including the concept of implementation and commercialization, also proved to be extremely promising.". By reading these two assertions, it becomes unclear for the reader if the developed approach is feasible from the economic point of view or not. Therefore, it will benefit the paper if the authors elaborate and present in the "Results and discussion" section a cost-benefit analysis regarding the implementation of their proposed solution in a daily operating environment, taking into account all the involved costs. This cost-benefit analysis is necessary in order to prove that the devised solution is feasible to be implemented on a large scale and used on a daily basis from the economic point of view, taking into consideration also the maintenance costs. Consequently, the cost-benefit analysis cannot be postponed  in a future work and must be addressed  within the current manuscript.	{"937, 946, TRIGGER","3, 16, LOCATION","949, 955, ACTION","70, 75, ACTION","640, 644, MODAL","202, 209, TRIGGER","3, 16, LOCATION","25, 48, LOCATION","77, 276, LOCATION","292, 305, LOCATION","314, 327, LOCATION","356, 479, LOCATION","1181, 1188, MODAL","1156, 1181, CONTENT","1142, 1154, TRIGGER","1192, 1201, ACTION","956, 1140, CONTENT","1242, 1272, CONTENT","517, 532, ACTION","1231, 1241, ACTION","1224, 1228, MODAL","1203, 1219, CONTENT","547, 550, TRIGGER","551, 624, CONTENT","626, 635, TRIGGER","640, 644, MODAL","678, 687, ACTION","707, 731, LOCATION","692, 699, ACTION","740, 896, CONTENT","644, 652, ACTION","663, 665, TRIGGER","898, 924, CONTENT","927, 937, ACTION"}
11726	The "Results and discussion" section. In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Results and discussion" section, the authors should make a comparison between their approach from the manuscript and other similar ones that have been developed in the literature for the same or related purposes. There are a lot of valuable studies in the scientific literature related to the subject of the manuscript to which the authors can compare to and this comparison will highlight even more the novel aspects that their paper brought in contrast to the existing   studies.	{"4, 28, LOCATION","423, 428, TRIGGER","146, 152, MODAL","444, 572, ACTION","17, 27, LOCATION","490, 582, CONTENT","481, 490, ACTION","476, 481, MODAL","460, 475, CONTENT","445, 455, ACTION","441, 444, MODAL","422, 428, TRIGGER","158, 312, CONTENT","153, 157, ACTION","146, 152, MODAL","100, 124, LOCATION","314, 419, CONTENT"}
11727	The "Results and discussion" section. The authors should present the findings and their main implications in the "Results and discussion" section, also highlighting current limitations of their study, and briefly mention some precise directions that they intend to follow in their future research work.	{"50, 64, ACTION","50, 56, MODAL","57, 64, ACTION","65, 105, CONTENT","3, 28, LOCATION","113, 137, LOCATION","152, 164, ACTION","165, 199, CONTENT","205, 220, ACTION","221, 301, CONTENT","17, 27, LOCATION"}
11728	The "Discussion" section. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their analysis and provide an insight at the end of the "Results and discussion" section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained results, the most important, appropriate and concrete actions that the decisional factors and all the involved parties should take in order to benefit from the results of the research conducted within the manuscript.	{"127, 134, ACTION","233, 470, CONTENT","5, 15, LOCATION","52, 56, MODAL","207, 211, TRIGGER","135, 145, CONTENT","164, 188, LOCATION","207, 211, TRIGGER","217, 231, ACTION","65, 67, TRIGGER","52, 56, MODAL","4, 16, LOCATION"}

11730	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: mathematics-385356, having the title "Identifying the Informational/Signal Dimension in Principal Component Analysis". In this paper, the authors analyze the ability of ten different methods in distinguishing signal from noise in Principal Component Analysis. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors address within the manuscript the following  aspects:	{"20, 53, LOCATION","325, 392, ACTION","20, 30, LOCATION","357, 378, LOCATION","379, 401, CONTENT","72, 152, LOCATION","349, 356, ACTION","333, 336, TRIGGER","321, 325, MODAL"}
11731	Ø  The sections of the manuscript: In the actual form of the manuscript, its sections are: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Principal component analyses and true dimension, 3. The simulation, 4. Stopping rules, 5. Results, 6. Discussion, 7. Conclusion, Funding, References. According to the MDPI Mathematics Journal's Template, it is recommended that a research paper contain the following sections: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5. Conclusions (not mandatory), 6. Patents (not mandatory), Supplementary Materials (not mandatory), Author Contributions, Funding, Acknowledgments, Conflicts of Interest, Appendices and References. The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the above-mentioned template that provides a more logical structure, which is much more appropriate for a research article. Moreover, one of the most important sections presented in the MDPI Mathematics Journal's Template is missing: the "Materials and Methods" section. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to better express the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge.	{"269, 279, LOCATION","341, 352, ACTION","358, 405, CONTENT","407, 694, CONTENT","696, 723, LOCATION","724, 728, MODAL","729, 736, ACTION","737, 739, TRIGGER","746, 758, ACTION","760, 900, CONTENT","847, 852, TRIGGER","902, 910, TRIGGER","912, 999, CONTENT","1002, 1010, ACTION","1016, 1039, CONTENT","1049, 1084, CONTENT","1085, 1089, MODAL","1095, 1099, ACTION","1100, 1231, CONTENT","724, 728, MODAL","3, 33, LOCATION","38, 71, LOCATION","91, 99, LOCATION","101, 109, LOCATION","111, 126, LOCATION","128, 178, LOCATION","180, 198, LOCATION","199, 216, LOCATION","218, 228, LOCATION","230, 243, LOCATION","245, 258, LOCATION","260, 267, LOCATION","23, 33, LOCATION","151, 159, ACTION"}
11732	Ø  Lines 1-14: In the "Abstract" of the paper, the authors must present in a clearer manner the following  aspects: the background, the methods, the main findings, the conclusions, as in the actual form of the manuscript, the abstract offers information related only to some of these aspects and even so, their delimitation is unclear. In the "Abstract" of the paper, along with the above-mentioned elements, the authors should briefly state the novelty of their proposed approach.	{"442, 480, CONTENT","343, 353, LOCATION","296, 303, TRIGGER","421, 427, MODAL","63, 105, ACTION","221, 234, LOCATION","3, 13, LOCATION","187, 220, LOCATION","71, 179, CONTENT","64, 71, ACTION","58, 63, MODAL","21, 32, LOCATION","3, 13, LOCATION","421, 427, MODAL","428, 441, ACTION"}
11733	Ø  Lines 17-56: In its current form, the "Introduction" section contains a series of cited papers. I do not contradict the value of these papers, or their relevance in this context, but I consider that the article under review will benefit if the authors extend this section by analyzing appropriately the cited papers and by analyzing  more other papers. The purpose of the literature survey is to highlight exactly, for each of the involved referenced papers the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the method used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article. This is the only way to contextualize the current state of the art in which the authors of the manuscript position their paper and address aspects that have not been tackled/solved yet by the existing studies. By performing an adequately literature review, the authors will be able to highlight better the necessity and novelty of their approach.	{"842, 854, CONTENT","3, 14, LOCATION","41, 55, LOCATION","181, 185, TRIGGER","188, 196, ACTION","227, 231, MODAL","239, 242, TRIGGER","255, 261, ACTION","262, 274, LOCATION","275, 354, CONTENT","736, 794, CONTENT","798, 803, TRIGGER","833, 842, ACTION","859, 866, ACTION","867, 936, CONTENT","938, 983, CONTENT","997, 1001, MODAL","1005, 1029, ACTION","1029, 1073, CONTENT","3, 14, LOCATION","231, 335, ACTION","227, 231, MODAL","182, 185, TRIGGER"}
11734	Ø  In order to bring a benefit to the manuscript, the authors should state and justify very clear in the "Materials and Methods" section (that for the time being is missing completely from the manuscript), preferably within the first paragraph, the choices they have made when developing the final form of their proposed approach. The authors should state what has justified using  the logistic regression model, what is special, unexpected, or different in their research methodology. It will benefit if the authors mention if they have tried other approaches that in the end led them to the current form of their research design.	{"62, 74, ACTION","489, 493, MODAL","272, 276, TRIGGER","69, 74, ACTION","105, 128, LOCATION","165, 183, ACTION","189, 203, LOCATION","207, 329, CONTENT","343, 349, MODAL","350, 355, ACTION","356, 484, CONTENT","489, 493, MODAL","493, 501, ACTION","501, 504, TRIGGER","517, 524, ACTION","524, 631, CONTENT","62, 68, MODAL","79, 97, ACTION","34, 48, LOCATION","38, 48, LOCATION"}
11735	Ø  The equations within the manuscript must be numbered and should be explained  , demonstrated or cited, as there are some equations that have not been introduced in the literature for the first time by the authors and that are not cited.	{"39, 43, MODAL","46, 55, ACTION","60, 67, MODAL","70, 104, ACTION","39, 43, MODAL","3, 38, LOCATION","46, 80, ACTION","28, 38, LOCATION"}
11736	Ø  I consider that in addition to the actual explanations, in order to help the readers better understand the methodology of the conducted research and assure its reproducibility, the authors should devise a flowchart within the "Materials and Methods" section, a flowchart that depicts the steps that the authors have processed in developing their research and most important of all, the final target. This flowchart will facilitate the understanding of the proposed approach and in the same time will make the article more interesting  to the readers if used as a graphical abstract.	{"403, 417, CONTENT","418, 422, MODAL","422, 433, ACTION","433, 585, CONTENT","199, 205, ACTION","422, 536, ACTION","576, 584, LOCATION","192, 198, MODAL","192, 198, MODAL","206, 217, CONTENT","228, 253, LOCATION","261, 401, CONTENT"}
11737	Ø  In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Discussion" section, the authors should make a comparison between their proposed approach and other similar ones that have been designed and described in the literature for similar or related purposes. The authors should also highlight current limitations of their study, and briefly mention some precise directions that they intend to follow in their future research work.	{"302, 336, CONTENT","66, 76, LOCATION","207, 216, ACTION","99, 105, MODAL","341, 357, ACTION","99, 105, MODAL","358, 438, CONTENT","65, 77, LOCATION","124, 266, CONTENT","280, 286, MODAL","106, 123, ACTION","292, 301, ACTION"}
11738	Ø  The paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their approach and provide an insight at the end of the "Discussion" section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained results, the most important benefits of the research conducted within the manuscript, taking also into account its practical applicability.	{"156, 160, TRIGGER","162, 343, CONTENT","13, 17, MODAL","26, 28, TRIGGER","88, 95, ACTION","126, 136, LOCATION","13, 17, MODAL","156, 160, TRIGGER","96, 106, CONTENT","107, 118, LOCATION","124, 137, LOCATION"}
11739	Ø  After having written a proper "Discussion" section the authors should conclude their manuscript without restating  the results that they have already presented within the manuscript once again, instead they should conclude their study by pin pointing  in the manuscript what they have discovered and most important of all, what their findings mean to the scientific community. In the actual form of the manuscript, section 7 is entitled "Conclusion" but obviously the section depicts more than one conclusion. Therefore, the title "Conclusions" is more suitable.	{"66, 72, MODAL","273, 277, TRIGGER","33, 45, LOCATION","73, 81, ACTION","82, 195, CONTENT","197, 204, TRIGGER","210, 216, MODAL","217, 225, ACTION","225, 378, CONTENT","383, 416, LOCATION","418, 427, LOCATION","440, 452, LOCATION","453, 456, TRIGGER","513, 522, TRIGGER","524, 547, CONTENT","551, 564, ACTION","72, 116, ACTION","34, 44, LOCATION"}
11740	Ø  The "References" section contains (among other items), the references [47], [48], [49] that have not been cited in the manuscript at all. The authors must address this issue by citing in the paper only the references that have been used and by deleting  the ones that are not useful in the context of the manuscript. Moreover, at the Line 208, the authors have cited the reference [428], which does not exist, as the "References" section contains a list of 49 papers.	{"186, 239, CONTENT","247, 255, ACTION","258, 318, CONTENT","320, 328, TRIGGER","337, 345, LOCATION","370, 389, LOCATION","402, 411, ACTION","391, 396, TRIGGER","420, 432, LOCATION","441, 449, ACTION","450, 469, CONTENT","118, 132, LOCATION","85, 89, LOCATION","79, 83, LOCATION","62, 77, LOCATION","180, 186, ACTION","244, 246, TRIGGER","157, 255, ACTION","320, 328, TRIGGER","7, 19, LOCATION","122, 132, LOCATION","176, 179, TRIGGER","166, 176, CONTENT","158, 165, ACTION","153, 157, MODAL"}

11743	·   Line 20: "… it is usually split in additive ways along orthogonal straights, planes, etc." and Line 75: "…confirmatory factor analysis, clustering on factor scores, etc." (and all the similar cases). In a scientific paper one should avoid using  run-on expressions, such as "and so forth", "and so on" or "etc.". Therefore, instead of "etc.", the sentence should mention all the elements that are relevant to the manuscript.	{"98, 106, LOCATION","12, 94, LOCATION","339, 345, LOCATION","375, 428, CONTENT","367, 374, ACTION","236, 248, ACTION","4, 11, LOCATION","4, 11, LOCATION","360, 366, MODAL","327, 338, TRIGGER","316, 326, TRIGGER","249, 316, CONTENT","237, 248, ACTION","230, 236, MODAL","180, 201, LOCATION","108, 174, LOCATION"}
11744	After having assessed the suitability for publication of the Manuscript ID: energies-336370, having the title "Energy Consumption Optimization for the Formation of Multiple Robotic Fishes Using Particle Swarm Optimization", I have distinguished several elements that from my point of view should be made less confused  and more comprehensible by the authors in view of improving the quality of the manuscript.	{"304, 408, CONTENT","296, 303, ACTION","289, 295, MODAL","245, 261, CONTENT","231, 244, ACTION","289, 295, MODAL","188, 193, ACTION","61, 71, LOCATION","61, 91, LOCATION","110, 222, LOCATION"}
11745	The purpose of the paper consists in cutting down the consumption of energy throughout the formation of robotic fishes by optimizing the control parameters of the acceleration using the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). The authors have conducted experimental tests in order to confirm that a decrease in energy consumption is obtained by optimizing the acceleration’s control parameters by means of a PSO.	{"176, 181, ACTION"}
11746	I have noticed that the pdf manuscript submitted by the authors does not have its lines numbered, therefore it was needed to mention page numbers and text paragraphs in order to be able to pin point my comments. The article under review will be improved  if the authors address the following aspects in the text of the manuscript:	{"237, 241, MODAL","28, 38, LOCATION","303, 329, LOCATION","125, 132, ACTION","277, 299, CONTENT","270, 277, ACTION","255, 257, TRIGGER","237, 241, MODAL","122, 210, CONTENT","114, 121, ACTION","98, 107, TRIGGER"}
11747	Ø Comments regarding the sections of the manuscript:	{"21, 51, LOCATION","41, 51, LOCATION"}
11748	§   The article’s structure should be improved in order to make the article more comprehensible as in its current form it is not structured  appropriately. The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the MDPI Energies Journal's Template that provides a more logical structure that is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to better express the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review should be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5. Conclusions (not mandatory), 6. Patents (not mandatory), Supplementary Materials (not mandatory), Author Contributions, Funding, Acknowledgments, Conflicts of Interest, Appendices and References. Related also to the structure, I have observed that the manuscript has entitled the same section using two different names in the same time, specifically the section that should be named “References” is also named“Bibliography” on the next line. I consider that the author must address this redundancy and use only the recommended title of“References” for the respective section of the article.	{"219, 367, CONTENT","1228, 1311, CONTENT","1224, 1227, ACTION","1203, 1219, CONTENT","1196, 1203, ACTION","1191, 1195, MODAL","1149, 1162, LOCATION","1099, 1104, ACTION","1089, 1095, MODAL","1072, 1083, LOCATION","1059, 1071, TRIGGER","1131, 1145, LOCATION","1104, 1117, LOCATION","629, 916, CONTENT","603, 615, ACTION","592, 599, MODAL","565, 592, LOCATION","551, 563, TRIGGER","418, 549, CONTENT","414, 418, ACTION","404, 408, MODAL","368, 403, CONTENT","206, 219, ACTION","197, 199, TRIGGER","189, 196, ACTION","184, 188, MODAL","156, 183, LOCATION","47, 155, CONTENT","38, 46, ACTION","28, 34, MODAL","160, 170, LOCATION","37, 139, ACTION","28, 34, MODAL","4, 27, CONTENT"}

11750	§  I consider that the abstract of the manuscript under review will be improved  if the authors state and briefly explain at the end of the abstract the clear contribution that their study has brought to the current state of knowledge. In what concerns the rest of abstract, I appreciate the way how the authors have managed to structure it by covering the most important points of interest: the authors have positioned the manuscript’s topic in a broad context therefore covering appropriately the topic’s background; the authors have presented succinctly the methods they have employed  in order to attain the purpose of their study; the authors have summarized the most important outcomes of their study and the conclusion that one could draw.	{"63, 67, MODAL","71, 79, ACTION","96, 101, ACTION","106, 121, ACTION","122, 148, LOCATION","19, 62, LOCATION","254, 273, LOCATION","23, 31, LOCATION","70, 79, ACTION","63, 67, MODAL","148, 234, CONTENT","80, 83, TRIGGER","239, 243, TRIGGER"}
11751	Ø Comments regarding the "Introduction" section:	{"25, 39, LOCATION","26, 38, LOCATION"}
11752	§  In the Introduction section, the authors should state clearly the motivation for the work presented in the manuscript and prepare the readers for the structure of the paper. The authors should address the context, need, task, and finally they should detail the subsequent structuring  of the paper.	{"106, 120, LOCATION","44, 50, MODAL","44, 56, ACTION","6, 30, LOCATION","44, 50, MODAL","51, 64, ACTION","66, 102, CONTENT","124, 132, ACTION","132, 175, CONTENT","189, 195, MODAL","196, 203, ACTION","203, 228, CONTENT","246, 252, MODAL","253, 259, ACTION","260, 300, CONTENT","10, 22, LOCATION"}
11753	§  First, the authors should provide some context in order to guide the readers who are less familiar with the approached topic and to establish the importance of their work.	{"29, 36, ACTION","37, 127, CONTENT","22, 28, MODAL","135, 144, ACTION","22, 28, MODAL","145, 173, CONTENT"}
11754	§  Secondly, the authors should state the need for their work, by presenting it as an opposition between what the scientific community currently has and what it needs or wants.	{"25, 31, MODAL","32, 37, ACTION","38, 176, CONTENT","25, 37, ACTION","105, 109, TRIGGER"}
11755	§  Thirdly, the authors should indicate what they have done in their conducted study in order to address the existing  need, namely the task that they set out to solve.	{"24, 30, MODAL","30, 39, ACTION","40, 44, TRIGGER","40, 167, CONTENT","30, 117, ACTION"}
11756	§  Finally, the authors should preview the remainder of the paper in order to prepare the readers for the subsequent structuring of the manuscript.	{"136, 146, LOCATION","78, 85, ACTION","24, 30, MODAL","31, 38, ACTION","24, 30, MODAL","85, 146, CONTENT","78, 85, ACTION","66, 74, TRIGGER","38, 65, CONTENT"}
11757	§  In a scientific article, an important role of the“Introduction” section is to offer authors the opportunity to analyze in detail the current state of knowledge related to the manuscript’s topic, namely the most relevant scientific works in the field in order to be able to contextualize their study and familiarize the readers with what has been done in the literature and what advancement their study aims to bring in addition to the existing body of knowledge. I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover three (like the authors have did) or even more scientific works in a short sentence just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section.	{"507, 522, LOCATION","526, 531, ACTION","531, 693, CONTENT","52, 66, LOCATION","144, 149, ACTION","335, 339, TRIGGER","52, 66, LOCATION","488, 503, ACTION"}
11758	§  I consider that the authors should perform the literature review in a manner that emphasizes for each scientific work that was cited in the text of the manuscript the contribution that was made to the existing state of art, the approach that was employed along with a short description of the most important results that have been obtained along with the existing unsolved issues of the referenced studies. By doing so, the authors will be able to better place their study in a broad body of knowledge and highlight unsolved  problems that still exist regarding the subject that their manuscript addresses.	{"37, 212, ACTION","435, 439, MODAL","37, 45, ACTION","143, 147, LOCATION","519, 608, CONTENT","509, 518, ACTION","463, 504, CONTENT","440, 463, ACTION","434, 439, MODAL","46, 408, CONTENT","31, 37, MODAL"}
11759	§  The authors have cited some valuable works from the current state of art, works that are relevant to their study, but the literature review conducted within the Introduction section should be extended  as to cover a higher number of important scientific works from the literature (there are a lot of valuable open access studies in the MDPI platform that can be easily accessed ) and must be performed in a critical manner like I have explained  in the above comments.	{"208, 282, CONTENT","185, 191, MODAL","120, 184, CONTENT","117, 120, TRIGGER","394, 404, ACTION","405, 426, CONTENT","117, 120, TRIGGER","387, 391, MODAL","185, 191, MODAL","63, 68, ACTION","164, 176, LOCATION","195, 203, ACTION"}
11760	§  After having extended and performed the literature survey in an appropriate manner, the authors will be able to pin point an exact deficiency, an unsolved problem that still exists in the current body of knowledge that their study addresses. This aspect will improve the manuscript under review on multiple plans, as the identified deficiency, the identified unsolved problem will offer great opportunities to highlight and prove in the Discussion section the contribution, the advancement that the conducted research has brought to the existing state of knowledge.	{"549, 554, ACTION","458, 567, CONTENT","436, 458, LOCATION","390, 409, CONTENT","104, 118, ACTION","270, 297, LOCATION","99, 103, MODAL","320, 378, CONTENT","379, 383, MODAL","384, 389, ACTION","257, 261, MODAL","427, 432, ACTION","261, 269, ACTION","413, 422, ACTION","98, 103, MODAL","119, 244, CONTENT","274, 284, LOCATION"}
11761	§  Just like in the case of the abstract, it will benefit to state the novel aspects of the conducted study, only this time to position the statements before the final paragraph of the Introduction section in which the authors detail how their paper is structured subsequently.	{"127, 135, ACTION","28, 40, LOCATION","45, 49, MODAL","61, 66, ACTION","68, 107, CONTENT","109, 113, TRIGGER","135, 277, CONTENT","32, 40, LOCATION","61, 66, ACTION","45, 49, MODAL","209, 214, TRIGGER"}
11762	§  I have noticed that the“Materials and Methods” section that should offer abundant details regarding the method devised by the authors while in the same time should be concisely presenting and citing  widely known methods, is scattered across the manuscript into multiple different sections like section number 2 entitled“Model of robotic fish” and section number 3 entitled“Energy optimized leader-follower formation algorithm”. I strongly believe that before proceeding to present the very important elements of their devised approach in the“Materials and Methods” section that must provide the precise details concerning  the authors’ conducted research in order to assure the its reproducibility, a good starting point consists in unifying the above-mentioned section 2 and section 3 in the“Materials and Methods” section.	{"586, 594, ACTION","724, 745, ACTION","703, 724, CONTENT","595, 701, CONTENT","793, 827, CONTENT","779, 789, LOCATION","766, 775, LOCATION","545, 568, LOCATION","26, 49, LOCATION","69, 201, ACTION","63, 69, MODAL","26, 49, LOCATION","63, 69, MODAL","70, 75, ACTION","76, 136, CONTENT","136, 143, TRIGGER","160, 166, MODAL","170, 190, ACTION","195, 202, ACTION","203, 223, CONTENT","225, 237, ACTION","238, 297, CONTENT","298, 314, LOCATION","323, 346, LOCATION","351, 367, LOCATION","376, 430, LOCATION","582, 586, MODAL"}
11763	§  When presenting the devised method, it will be extremely helpful to design and insert a diagram depicting the main sequence of steps that one has to process in order to reproduce the results of the conducted  study. This diagram should be analyzed in detail within the manuscript by specifying all the elements needed  for each and every step, in order to reach the final result of the method.	{"8, 18, ACTION","297, 345, CONTENT","286, 296, ACTION","283, 285, TRIGGER","261, 282, LOCATION","242, 250, ACTION","219, 231, CONTENT","232, 238, MODAL","181, 217, CONTENT","172, 181, ACTION","160, 168, TRIGGER","89, 159, CONTENT","82, 88, ACTION","70, 77, ACTION","50, 67, ACTION","42, 46, MODAL","42, 46, MODAL","31, 37, LOCATION"}
11764	§  Just like when a portion of text that expresses an idea, a concept, a definition that has not been invented by an author has to cite and give appropriate credit to the original source, a mathematical formalism is subjected to the same requirements in a scientific article. If a definition, a statement is being expressed by using a mathematical formalism that was not brought to the current state of knowledge by the authors, the source must be cited . Consequently, as in the manuscript under review one can find equations that were not devised for the first time in the scientific literature by the authors, I consider that it is appropriately to cite their source. In what concerns the equations that were devised by the authors for the first time, they should be explained in detail so that the reader can understand clearly how the authors arrived  at the respective equations.	{"278, 428, CONTENT","440, 444, MODAL","770, 779, ACTION","13, 17, TRIGGER","688, 753, CONTENT","760, 766, MODAL","31, 35, LOCATION","327, 332, ACTION","657, 669, CONTENT","476, 503, LOCATION","456, 468, TRIGGER","448, 453, ACTION","440, 444, MODAL","430, 439, CONTENT","652, 656, ACTION","275, 278, TRIGGER"}
11765	§  I have observed that the“Results” section, which should offer an exact and succinct analysis of the obtained results after having  performed the experiments, a clear interpretation along with clear conclusions towards the registered experimental results, exists to a certain extent in section 4 of the manuscript, entitled“Performance Evaluation”. I consider that section 4 of the manuscript should be transformed  in a proper“Results” section.	{"58, 132, ACTION","27, 36, LOCATION","52, 58, MODAL","46, 51, TRIGGER","421, 447, CONTENT","404, 416, ACTION","395, 401, MODAL","367, 394, LOCATION","325, 349, LOCATION","288, 315, LOCATION","65, 159, CONTENT","58, 64, ACTION","52, 58, MODAL","27, 36, LOCATION"}
11766	§  It is only after having a proper“Results” section that the authors can advance their study to an extremely important section, the“Discussion” one, in which they can finally compare the obtained experimental results, the devised method, the overall approach to other studies that have tackled similar problems but had limitations that their paper addressed (a clear connection will be made to the Introduction section).	{"176, 183, ACTION","73, 82, ACTION","70, 73, MODAL","9, 19, TRIGGER","150, 158, TRIGGER","164, 167, MODAL","153, 158, TRIGGER","176, 183, ACTION","70, 73, MODAL","184, 359, CONTENT","361, 378, CONTENT","35, 44, LOCATION","378, 383, MODAL","387, 391, ACTION","395, 419, LOCATION","82, 149, CONTENT"}
11767	Ø Comments regarding the "Discussion" section:	{"25, 37, LOCATION","26, 36, LOCATION"}
11768	§  The very important“Discussion” section does not exist in the manuscript under review. I consider that this section must be mandatory elaborated  in order for the authors to prove a contribution that their research has brought to the current state of knowledge. It is the“Discussion” section that offers the possibility to validate the contribution and usefulness of the conducted study from the manuscript by comparing the research design, the developed method, the registered experimental results with the ones obtained by other valuable scientific works.	{"2, 41, CONTENT","118, 122, MODAL","125, 146, ACTION","21, 33, LOCATION","181, 262, CONTENT","176, 181, ACTION","148, 156, TRIGGER","126, 146, ACTION","118, 123, MODAL","105, 117, CONTENT","60, 87, LOCATION","47, 56, ACTION","273, 285, LOCATION"}
11769	§  In the“Discussion” section it will benefit to examine, to debate the registered results and the way how they can be regarded with prospects to preceding researches that have targeted  similar goals. Unfortunately, in the current form of the manuscript under review this discussion, this debate does not exist. The authors must address these important aspects in order to be able to pin point exactly the clear advancement that their conducted study from manuscript has made to the current body of knowledge.	{"325, 329, MODAL","103, 106, TRIGGER","33, 37, MODAL","9, 29, CONTENT","389, 509, CONTENT","118, 185, ACTION","9, 21, LOCATION","201, 215, TRIGGER","374, 388, ACTION","361, 370, TRIGGER","330, 337, ACTION","33, 37, MODAL","339, 361, CONTENT"}
11770	§  It is in the“Discussion” section where the authors should underline both the advantages and disadvantages of their developed method when compared with other valuable studies from current state of art.	{"15, 27, LOCATION","36, 41, TRIGGER","12, 35, CONTENT","54, 60, MODAL","61, 70, ACTION","36, 41, TRIGGER","54, 60, MODAL","140, 148, ACTION","70, 203, CONTENT"}
11771	§  It will increase the value of the article if the authors mention in this section if they have tried other approaches before reaching  the current developed method from the manuscript and what did the results reveal that determined them to devise the current form of their method.	{"60, 67, ACTION","159, 165, LOCATION","10, 135, ACTION","190, 194, TRIGGER","6, 10, MODAL","45, 47, TRIGGER","190, 194, TRIGGER","71, 83, LOCATION","195, 281, CONTENT","84, 86, TRIGGER","86, 185, CONTENT"}
11772	§  The scientific value of the developed method will be considerably increased if the authors provide an insight regarding the feasibility of implementing the devised method in a real production environment, highlighting if the research can be reproduced and implemented  in a real case everyday use scenario by providing the very important implementation details.	{"79, 81, TRIGGER","93, 101, ACTION","102, 206, CONTENT","208, 220, ACTION","221, 223, TRIGGER","223, 364, CONTENT","48, 52, MODAL","55, 166, ACTION","41, 47, LOCATION","48, 53, MODAL"}
11773	§  I consider that the manuscript will be considerably improved if the authors state clearly within the manuscript who are the potential beneficiaries of the devised  approach (proving once again the usefulness of the conducted study) and how will these potential beneficiaries be able to make use of the devised approach in their everyday activities. Are there any special constraints (material, ethical, financial or any other types) that have to be taken into account when employing the devised approach in a real case everyday use scenario?	{"64, 66, TRIGGER","23, 33, LOCATION","41, 165, ACTION","34, 38, MODAL","239, 242, TRIGGER","18, 33, LOCATION","34, 38, MODAL","79, 92, ACTION","93, 114, LOCATION","115, 351, CONTENT","351, 355, TRIGGER","356, 544, CONTENT"}
11774	§   In order to provide all the necessary details for assuring the reproducibility of the study, I consider that the detailed hardware and software configurations that were used when developing the method should be specified along with the necessary hardware and software configuration that are required  in order to achieve a proper implementation in a real case everyday use scenario.	{"198, 204, LOCATION","3, 12, TRIGGER","225, 386, CONTENT","215, 224, ACTION","205, 211, MODAL","205, 211, MODAL","178, 182, TRIGGER","114, 205, CONTENT","173, 177, ACTION"}
11775	§  The manuscript will be considerable improved if the authors offer their insight within the Discussion session towards the estimated benefits that will be obtained after putting  into practice their devised method in rapport with all the associated  implementation costs. Is the developed method feasible from the economic point of view?	{"18, 22, MODAL","274, 276, TRIGGER","277, 339, CONTENT","113, 273, CONTENT","83, 112, LOCATION","69, 83, CONTENT","63, 68, ACTION","47, 50, TRIGGER","18, 22, MODAL","25, 250, ACTION","7, 17, LOCATION"}
11776	§  The“Discussion” section is also a very suitable place for the authors to emphasize not only the novel aspects and strong points of their developed method, but also to point out objectively the existing limits of their method, possible circumstances that will hinder their method’s effectiveness and state clear and accurate directions they will pursue in their future research activities in order to extend the current research and overcome the existing  limitations. I have noticed that within the Conclusion section the authors have partially addressed this aspect, but I consider that the statements are more suitable for the Discussion section as this restructuring of the manuscript will allow a more in-depth rationale to be provided.	{"86, 156, CONTENT","651, 743, CONTENT","628, 650, LOCATION","610, 623, ACTION","591, 605, CONTENT","571, 574, TRIGGER","558, 569, CONTENT","538, 557, ACTION","491, 520, LOCATION","180, 469, CONTENT","167, 180, ACTION","157, 161, TRIGGER","76, 85, ACTION","6, 26, CONTENT","6, 18, LOCATION","302, 307, ACTION","257, 261, MODAL","158, 161, TRIGGER"}
11777	§  Regarding the final statements of the“Discussion” section, it will increase the manuscript’s value if the authors make, based on the overall elaborated discussions, a clear argumentative statement regarding the procedures, the facts or processes that one must follow in order to achieve, to attain an outcome from the developed method with maximum efficiency.	{"117, 121, ACTION","144, 154, ACTION","65, 69, MODAL","40, 60, LOCATION","167, 361, CONTENT","40, 52, LOCATION","101, 104, TRIGGER"}
11778	§  Although the conclusion section is optional, I consider that the manuscript will benefit if in the Conclusion section the authors will state the most important outcome of their work. The authors should avoid simply summarizing  the aspects that they have already stated in the body of the manuscript. Instead, they should interpret their findings at a higher level of abstraction than in the Discussion section. The authors should highlight whether, or to what extent they have managed to address the necessity identified within the Introduction section. The authors should avoid restating everything  they did once again, but instead they should emphasize what their findings actually mean to the readers, therefore making the Conclusion section interesting and memorable to them.	{"582, 624, CONTENT","626, 629, TRIGGER","642, 649, MODAL","459, 463, TRIGGER","660, 783, CONTENT","570, 576, MODAL","576, 582, ACTION","16, 26, LOCATION","133, 143, ACTION","326, 334, ACTION","335, 413, CONTENT","427, 433, MODAL","434, 443, ACTION","79, 83, MODAL","444, 556, CONTENT","133, 137, MODAL","211, 302, CONTENT","98, 120, LOCATION","304, 311, TRIGGER","92, 94, TRIGGER","318, 324, MODAL","138, 143, ACTION","143, 184, CONTENT","198, 204, MODAL","205, 210, ACTION","649, 659, ACTION"}
11779	§  At the end of the Conclusion, if they feel necessary, the authors can challenge the reader e.g. “One remaining aspect to reflect upon consists in …”	{"3, 31, LOCATION","98, 151, CONTENT","73, 82, ACTION","69, 72, MODAL","69, 72, MODAL","21, 31, LOCATION"}
11780	§  If the above-mentioned aspects from the review report are implemented by the reader this means the paper will have included a very well-structured Introduction and a correctly structured abstract, therefore the authors should not repeat any part from the Introduction in the Conclusion section. The authors should not restate (like they did in the current form of the manuscript) what they have done or what the article does, they should focus instead on what they have discovered and most important on what their findings mean.	{"240, 296, CONTENT","310, 316, MODAL","316, 328, ACTION","383, 427, CONTENT","16, 25, ACTION","108, 112, MODAL","150, 162, LOCATION","458, 530, CONTENT","383, 387, TRIGGER","441, 446, ACTION","3, 5, TRIGGER","6, 86, CONTENT","108, 112, MODAL","118, 126, ACTION","127, 198, CONTENT","434, 440, MODAL","199, 209, TRIGGER","221, 228, MODAL","229, 239, ACTION"}
11781	§  The authors should write a short Conclusion section, in fact they should conclude in just a few sentences given the rich discussion section from the body of the paper. I strongly recommend the authors to overcome the temptation to repeat material from the Introduction or from the rest of the paper only to make the Conclusion longer under the false belief that a longer Conclusion section will seem more impressive.	{"69, 84, ACTION","76, 84, ACTION","36, 46, LOCATION","15, 21, MODAL","15, 21, MODAL","22, 27, ACTION","28, 55, CONTENT","69, 75, MODAL","204, 419, CONTENT","172, 191, ACTION","84, 169, CONTENT"}
11782	I have reviewed the manuscript "Innovative methods for Small Mixed Batches Production System Improvement: Case of a Bakery Machine Manufacturer", Manuscript ID: sustainability-872379 that has been submitted for publication in the MDPI Sustainability Journal and I have identified a series of aspects that in my opinion must be addressed  in order to bring a benefit to the manuscript.	{"30, 144, LOCATION","356, 383, CONTENT","349, 355, ACTION","337, 346, TRIGGER","326, 336, ACTION","326, 336, ACTION","20, 30, LOCATION","319, 323, MODAL","318, 324, MODAL","146, 182, LOCATION"}
11783	In this paper (of Case Report type), the authors present the Lean Six Sigma (LSS) methodology for Small Mixed Batch (SMB) production system. The authors extend the standard set of LSS tools by making use of artificial neural networks and a machine learning approach. The LSS-SMB methodology is illustrated in the case study of a bakery machine turning process.	{"23, 29, ACTION"}
11784	I consider that the article will benefit if the authors take into account the following  remarks and address within the manuscript the signaled issues:	{"131, 150, CONTENT","109, 130, LOCATION","100, 108, ACTION","74, 96, CONTENT","56, 73, ACTION","40, 43, TRIGGER","27, 32, MODAL","120, 130, LOCATION","32, 87, ACTION"}
11785	Overall comments regarding the manuscript.	{"27, 41, LOCATION","31, 41, LOCATION"}
11786	The Manuscript ID: sustainability-872379 is interesting, but it still remains an aspect that must be clarified  by the authors, namely the fact that they must assume more clearly their own results. I consider that the authors must assume more clearly in the paper their original contribution by specifying this fact and by highlighting the fact that starting  from a certain point there are presented the original and novel aspects of their paper. The authors must state more clearly their original methods, their original results and conclusions, the novelty of their study. In the current form of the paper, this aspect is unclear.	{"101, 111, ACTION","154, 158, MODAL","159, 178, ACTION","179, 196, CONTENT","460, 464, MODAL","483, 574, CONTENT","465, 483, ACTION","93, 97, MODAL","78, 88, CONTENT","57, 60, TRIGGER","93, 97, MODAL","100, 110, ACTION","4, 14, LOCATION","336, 446, CONTENT","323, 336, ACTION","306, 315, CONTENT","294, 305, ACTION","265, 291, CONTENT","254, 263, LOCATION","231, 250, ACTION","226, 230, MODAL","4, 40, LOCATION","57, 60, TRIGGER"}
11787	Specific comments regarding the manuscript.	{"32, 42, LOCATION","28, 42, LOCATION"}
11788	Remark 1 – lines 20-32, the "Abstract" of the paper. In the "Abstract" of the paper, the authors must present in a clearer manner the following  aspects: the background, the methods, the main findings, the conclusions, as in the actual form of the manuscript, the abstract offers information related only to some of these aspects and even so, their delimitation is unclear.	{"11, 22, LOCATION","110, 219, CONTENT","101, 143, ACTION","11, 22, LOCATION","60, 70, LOCATION","97, 101, MODAL","102, 109, ACTION","28, 39, LOCATION"}
11789	Remark 2 – line 87, the "Introduction" section. "Our research started with a literary survey in Emerald Insight and MDPI databases…" I do not contradict the value of this approach, or its relevance in this context, but I consider that the article under review will benefit if the authors explain in the paper what was the criteria in their research methodology based on which they have decided to analyze only papers from the two above-mentioned sources.	{"215, 218, TRIGGER","273, 275, TRIGGER","288, 295, ACTION","309, 454, CONTENT","11, 18, LOCATION","288, 295, ACTION","260, 264, MODAL","215, 218, TRIGGER","260, 264, MODAL","11, 18, LOCATION","24, 39, LOCATION","48, 132, LOCATION"}
11790	Remark 3 – the gap in the scientific literature. After having performed a critical survey of what has been done up to this point in the scientific literature, the authors must identify and state more clearly in the paper a gap in the current state of knowledge that needs to be filled, a gap that is being addressed by their manuscript. This gap must also be used afterwards, in the "Discussion" section of the manuscript as well, where the authors should justify why their approach fills the identified gap in rapport with previous studies from the literature.	{"189, 194, ACTION","171, 175, MODAL","93, 97, TRIGGER","11, 47, LOCATION","171, 176, MODAL","176, 184, ACTION","189, 207, ACTION","221, 335, CONTENT","346, 350, MODAL","356, 374, ACTION","382, 395, LOCATION","431, 436, TRIGGER","449, 455, MODAL","455, 463, ACTION","464, 560, CONTENT","325, 335, LOCATION"}
11791	Remark 4 – the "Introduction" section. At the end of the "Introduction" section, the authors should present the structure of their paper, under the form: "The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 contains…".	{"109, 224, CONTENT","93, 107, ACTION","16, 28, LOCATION","15, 29, LOCATION","41, 79, LOCATION","93, 99, MODAL","100, 107, ACTION"}
11792	Remark 5 – subsection "3.4. Data analysis", lines 317-320. "The second model uses feedforward ANN described in section 2.3 trained with Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm. The network has one hidden layer with ten neurons with a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid activation function. The output layer has one neuron with a linear activation function." As the authors have used an Artificial Neural Network approach, I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors present more details regarding the results obtained during  various tests, for different training algorithms, for all the different number of neurons and epochs tested and especially the training time for each test, until they have obtained the configuration that has provided the best results. The information can be summarized  in a table and if it becomes too long, the authors can restrict it in the paper to ten main experimental runs, and a complete table with all the experimental runs must be inserted  in the Supplementary Materials file of the article. The authors must specify in the paper how often does the network need to be retrained/updated and how did the authors tackle the need of retraining/updating the network. How is the data encountered stored for subsequent updates of the network?	{"44, 57, LOCATION","1212, 1279, CONTENT","1207, 1210, TRIGGER","1075, 1205, CONTENT","1054, 1061, ACTION","1049, 1053, MODAL","988, 1035, CONTENT","974, 983, ACTION","967, 971, MODAL","919, 966, CONTENT","868, 913, CONTENT","859, 867, ACTION","855, 858, MODAL","822, 841, CONTENT","819, 821, TRIGGER","804, 814, CONTENT","792, 802, ACTION","785, 788, MODAL","769, 784, CONTENT","482, 768, CONTENT","474, 481, ACTION","458, 462, TRIGGER","59, 355, LOCATION","22, 42, LOCATION","44, 57, LOCATION","77, 81, ACTION","785, 788, MODAL","1075, 1078, TRIGGER"}
11793	Remark 6 – subsection "3.4. Data analysis", issue regarding the dataset. The authors must provide more details regarding the way in which they have solved the problems related to missing  data or abnormal values if they have occurred.	{"89, 186, ACTION","90, 97, ACTION","98, 234, CONTENT","22, 42, LOCATION","85, 89, MODAL","132, 137, TRIGGER"}
11794	Remark 7 – the "Discussion" section. In the actual form of the paper, the "Discussion" section is rather a "Results" one, as in this section the authors have provided a table containing the results of their study. Actually, this section contains a large table, spreading along page 12 and a half of page 13, table through which the authors have presented a large amount of information, without analyzing it. In fact, the table is not used in order to synthesize the information but rather to present it. The authors must explain and analyze in detail all the tables and figures that have been inserted within the manuscript, it is not suitable to put the reader in the situation of interpreting, analyzing, continuing or refining the study from the manuscript under review.	{"345, 354, ACTION","107, 117, CONTENT","74, 86, LOCATION","541, 623, CONTENT","533, 540, ACTION","520, 528, ACTION","516, 520, MODAL","15, 27, LOCATION","322, 327, TRIGGER","16, 26, LOCATION"}
11795	Remark 8 – the "Discussion" section. In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Discussion" section, the authors should make a comparison between their study from the manuscript and other ones that have been developed and used in the literature for the same or similar purposes. There are a lot of valuable studies in the scientific literature related to the subject of the manuscript to which the authors can compare to and this comparison will highlight even more the insights that their paper has brought in contrast to the existing   studies. This comparison is mandatory in order to highlight the clear contribution to the current state of knowledge that the authors have brought.	{"133, 139, MODAL","475, 565, CONTENT","567, 582, CONTENT","16, 26, LOCATION","617, 703, CONTENT","608, 617, ACTION","595, 604, TRIGGER","408, 413, TRIGGER","586, 595, ACTION","461, 465, MODAL","466, 475, ACTION","445, 460, CONTENT","158, 297, CONTENT","140, 157, ACTION","99, 111, LOCATION","133, 139, MODAL","15, 27, LOCATION","242, 246, ACTION"}
11796	Remark 9 – the "Discussion" section. In the "Discussion" section the authors should also highlight current limitations of their study and briefly mention some precise directions that they intend to follow in their future research work. The authors should highlight whether, or to what extent they have managed to address the necessity identified within the "Introduction" section. In this section the authors must present in a clearer manner the learnings and insights of their research.	{"248, 254, MODAL","280, 284, TRIGGER","77, 83, MODAL","146, 153, ACTION","16, 26, LOCATION","15, 27, LOCATION","44, 56, LOCATION","77, 83, MODAL","89, 98, ACTION","99, 133, CONTENT","138, 153, ACTION","155, 234, CONTENT","255, 264, ACTION","346, 379, LOCATION","280, 284, TRIGGER","285, 345, CONTENT","408, 413, MODAL","414, 421, ACTION","440, 486, CONTENT"}
11797	Remark 10 – the "Discussion " section. The paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their approach and provide an insight at the end of the "Discussion" section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained results, the most important, appropriate and concrete actions that the decisional factors and all the involved parties should take in order to benefit from the results of the research conducted within the manuscript as to attain the ultimate goal of sustainability.	{"17, 27, LOCATION","124, 131, ACTION","132, 142, CONTENT","196, 505, CONTENT","192, 196, TRIGGER","146, 181, LOCATION","61, 64, TRIGGER","16, 29, LOCATION","192, 196, TRIGGER","49, 53, MODAL"}
11798	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: sustainability-426194, with the title "Optimization of the Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem with Consideration of Carbon Emissions and Time Windows". In this paper, the authors analyze a model of simultaneous pickup and delivery vehicle routing problem, considering carbon emissions and time windows. The authors state that their results provided helpful suggestions, for the logistics companies on controlling carbon emissions during distribution, and also for the government on decisions of carbon quota and carbon trading price. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors address within the manuscript the following  aspects:	{"20, 30, LOCATION","372, 377, ACTION","617, 621, MODAL","676, 697, CONTENT","653, 674, LOCATION","645, 653, ACTION","630, 632, TRIGGER","73, 207, LOCATION","20, 56, LOCATION"}
11799	Ø  The sections of the manuscript. In the actual form of the paper, its sections are not according to the ones recommended by the Sustainability MDPI Journal's Template. The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the above-mentioned template that provides a more logical structure that is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to better express the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review should be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5. Conclusions (not mandatory), 6. Patents (not mandatory), Supplementary Materials (not mandatory), Author Contributions, Funding, Acknowledgments, Conflicts of Interest, Appendices and References.	{"374, 409, CONTENT","23, 33, LOCATION","111, 122, ACTION","198, 202, MODAL","425, 555, CONTENT","419, 424, ACTION","410, 415, MODAL","234, 373, CONTENT","220, 232, ACTION","3, 33, LOCATION","211, 213, TRIGGER","557, 569, TRIGGER","198, 203, MODAL","599, 605, MODAL","571, 598, LOCATION","609, 621, ACTION","635, 922, CONTENT"}
11800	Ø  The "Abstract" of the paper. Taking into consideration that this is a research article, the abstract should offer a relevant overview of the work. It will benefit the paper if the authors provide a structured abstract, that covers the following aspects: the background (in which the authors should place the issue that the manuscript addresses in a broad context and highlight the purpose of the study), the methods used to solve the identified issue (that should be briefly described ), a summary of the article's main findings followed by the main conclusions or interpretations. In the abstract the authors must also declare and briefly justify the novelty of their work.	{"588, 600, LOCATION","111, 116, ACTION","199, 583, CONTENT","116, 148, CONTENT","276, 281, TRIGGER","191, 198, ACTION","104, 110, MODAL","419, 423, ACTION","7, 17, LOCATION","91, 103, LOCATION","103, 110, MODAL","175, 178, TRIGGER","652, 676, CONTENT","8, 16, LOCATION","635, 650, ACTION","623, 630, ACTION","613, 617, MODAL"}
11801	Ø  The "Introduction" section. After having performed a critical survey of what has been done up to this point in the scientific literature, the authors must identify a gap in the current state of knowledge that needs to be filled, a gap that is being addressed by their manuscript. This gap must also be used afterwards, in the "Discussion" section of the manuscript which is currently missing from the manuscript) as well, where the authors should justify why their approach fills the identified gap in rapport with previous studies from the literature. In the "Introduction" section the authors must also declare the novel aspects of their work. At the end of the Introduction, the authors must present the structure of their paper under the form: "The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 contains…".	{"597, 602, MODAL","608, 615, ACTION","615, 647, CONTENT","648, 679, LOCATION","692, 697, MODAL","698, 705, ACTION","705, 820, CONTENT","400, 414, LOCATION","377, 394, ACTION","328, 341, LOCATION","367, 373, TRIGGER","302, 320, ACTION","188, 193, ACTION","8, 20, LOCATION","75, 79, TRIGGER","153, 157, MODAL","292, 296, MODAL","167, 281, CONTENT","158, 167, ACTION","30, 37, TRIGGER","153, 157, MODAL","7, 21, LOCATION","425, 430, TRIGGER","443, 449, MODAL","449, 457, ACTION","458, 554, CONTENT","562, 577, LOCATION"}
11802	Ø  The "Materials and Methods" section is missing. I consider that it will benefit the manuscript if the authors include a "Materials and Methods" section (in the actual form of the manuscript this section is missing), in which the new developed methods should be described  in detail while well-established methods (and information) can be briefly described and appropriately cited .	{"42, 49, ACTION","87, 97, LOCATION","42, 49, ACTION","70, 74, MODAL","222, 227, TRIGGER","70, 74, MODAL","7, 30, LOCATION","97, 100, TRIGGER","112, 120, ACTION","123, 154, CONTENT","222, 227, TRIGGER","227, 253, CONTENT","254, 260, MODAL","264, 273, ACTION","285, 290, TRIGGER","291, 333, CONTENT","334, 337, MODAL","340, 358, ACTION","363, 382, ACTION"}
11803	Ø  The flowchart. In order to help the readers better understand the methodology of the conducted study, in the "Materials and Methods" section the authors should devise a flowchart that depicts the steps that they have processed in developing  their research and most important of all, the final target. This flowchart will facilitate the understanding of the proposed approach and in the same time will make the article more interesting  to the readers if used as a graphical abstract.	{"478, 486, LOCATION","409, 486, CONTENT","405, 409, ACTION","400, 404, MODAL","324, 353, ACTION","320, 324, MODAL","305, 319, CONTENT","169, 304, CONTENT","163, 169, ACTION","156, 162, MODAL","112, 143, LOCATION","3, 16, LOCATION","320, 324, MODAL","162, 243, ACTION"}
11804	Ø  The equations. All the equations within the manuscript should be explained , demonstrated or cited, as there are some equations that have not been introduced in the literature for the first time by the authors and that are not cited.	{"2, 16, LOCATION","58, 64, MODAL","67, 77, ACTION","47, 57, LOCATION","68, 101, ACTION","18, 57, LOCATION","58, 64, MODAL"}
11805	Ø  Lines 145-151. These lines contain a subsection entitled "3.2. Problem assumprion". First of all, the "assumprion" word is a misspelling of the "assumption" one. Secondly, the five assumptions considered by the authors are only four, as No. 3 and No. 4 are identical. Moreover, the assumption that is presented twice seems impossible to be practically attained: "All vehicles travel at a constant speed and keep the same speed during transport." I consider that the authors should specify in the paper whether neglecting  the traffic congestion that tends to occur frequently does not affect the consistency of their study.	{"271, 279, TRIGGER","3, 16, LOCATION","60, 85, LOCATION","105, 117, LOCATION","513, 626, CONTENT","484, 491, ACTION","477, 483, MODAL","320, 336, ACTION","280, 319, CONTENT","365, 448, LOCATION","256, 269, ACTION","250, 255, LOCATION","87, 99, TRIGGER","164, 173, TRIGGER","239, 245, LOCATION","175, 235, CONTENT","143, 163, CONTENT","128, 139, ACTION","271, 279, TRIGGER","304, 313, ACTION","3, 16, LOCATION"}
11806	Ø  The "Discussion" section is missing. In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Discussion" section (which is currently missing from the manuscript), the authors should make a comparison between their approach from the manuscript and other similar ones that have been developed in the literature for the same or related purposes. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their analysis and provide an insight at the end of the "Discussion" section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained results, the most important, appropriate and concrete actions that the decisional factors and all the involved parties should take in order to benefit from the results of the research conducted within the manuscript as to attain the ultimate goal of sustainability.	{"8, 18, LOCATION","31, 38, ACTION","185, 191, MODAL","392, 394, TRIGGER","124, 129, TRIGGER","454, 461, ACTION","461, 835, CONTENT","2, 27, LOCATION","30, 38, ACTION","102, 122, CONTENT","185, 191, MODAL","191, 209, ACTION","209, 352, CONTENT","379, 383, MODAL"}
11807	Ø  The Figures from the paper. Figure 2 is not referred in the paper. At Figure 5, the titles and the measurement units of both axes are missing. At Figures 6-8, the titles of both axes are missing, while the measurement units of the Oy axes are missing. Regarding Figure 5: for consistency reasons, in a scientific article one should not represent on the same chart different physical entities (total cost and carbon emissions). Consequently, the authors should present different charts for the two different entities.	{"199, 204, TRIGGER","328, 334, MODAL","47, 55, ACTION","7, 14, LOCATION","2, 29, LOCATION","31, 39, LOCATION","43, 55, ACTION","73, 81, LOCATION","83, 132, CONTENT","137, 144, ACTION","149, 160, LOCATION","162, 185, CONTENT","189, 197, ACTION","205, 241, CONTENT","246, 253, ACTION","264, 273, LOCATION","328, 334, MODAL","335, 348, ACTION","348, 428, CONTENT","430, 442, TRIGGER","455, 462, MODAL","463, 470, ACTION","471, 518, CONTENT"}
11808	Ø  Line 300. "We use the data in Reference [41] in the case." I would like the authors to provide more details regarding  the dataset. Moreover, since reference 41 is published in 2017, I would like the authors to comment in the paper whether the data collected previously (probably before 2017) are still relevant today, in 2019, in what concerns the same problem. The authors should provide explanations whether their study is consistent, whether the changes that may occur within the older dataset from the above-mentioned period and the current year risk altering the final result. Another important issue regards the above-mentioned reference [41]. Please provide more details regarding this work, as in the current form of the paper these details are missing in the References section. Is it a book, a scientific paper, a conference paper or a thesis? Is it publicly available? I could not find it anywhere. Therefore, the authors should either provide more details, or offer another reference that could be found and consulted .	{"151, 163, LOCATION","214, 221, ACTION","13, 62, LOCATION","98, 133, CONTENT","89, 97, ACTION","3, 11, LOCATION","3, 11, LOCATION","17, 20, ACTION","64, 69, MODAL","135, 143, TRIGGER","378, 384, MODAL","385, 392, ACTION","392, 584, CONTENT","638, 652, LOCATION","661, 668, ACTION","669, 702, CONTENT","792, 883, CONTENT","914, 923, TRIGGER","937, 943, MODAL","951, 958, ACTION","976, 981, ACTION","959, 971, CONTENT","982, 1033, CONTENT","135, 143, MODAL","222, 364, CONTENT"}

11811	I have reviewed the Manuscript ID: sustainability-441193, with the title "Semi-Dry Carbonation Process Using Fly Ash from Solid Refused Fuel Power Plant". In this paper, the authors evaluate the utilization of the fly ash from solid refused fuel power plant as a solid sorbent material for CO2 capture via semi-dry carbonation reaction in order to decide if this represents an economically feasible CO2 reduction technique. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors address within the manuscript the following  aspects:	{"103, 108, ACTION","73, 153, LOCATION","463, 465, TRIGGER","478, 485, ACTION","486, 507, LOCATION","507, 530, CONTENT","19, 56, LOCATION","450, 454, MODAL","20, 30, LOCATION"}
11812	Ø  The sections of the manuscript. Most of the sections of the manuscript in its actual form are according to the ones recommended by the Sustainability MDPI Journal's Template. However, the very important "Discussion" section, recommended by the Sustainability MDPI Journal's Template, is missing. The manuscript under review will benefit if the authors devise an appropriate "Discussion" section and add it to the manuscript.	{"402, 405, ACTION","178, 185, TRIGGER","23, 33, LOCATION","119, 130, ACTION","327, 331, MODAL","327, 332, MODAL","3, 33, LOCATION","178, 185, TRIGGER","35, 73, LOCATION","290, 297, ACTION","188, 226, CONTENT","340, 342, TRIGGER","355, 361, ACTION","362, 398, CONTENT","406, 426, CONTENT"}
11813	Ø  Lines 9-17, the "Abstract" of the paper. Taking into consideration that this is a research article, the abstract should offer a relevant overview of the work. It will benefit the paper if the authors provide a structured abstract, that covers the following aspects: the background (in which the authors should place the issue that the manuscript addresses in a broad context and highlight the purpose of the study), the methods used to solve the identified issue (that should be briefly described ), a summary of the article's main findings followed by the main conclusions or interpretations. In the abstract the authors must also declare and briefly justify the novelty of their work. In the actual form of the manuscript, the abstract offers information related only to some of these aspects and even so, their delimitation is unclear.	{"288, 293, TRIGGER","3, 13, LOCATION","431, 435, ACTION","116, 122, MODAL","3, 13, LOCATION","19, 29, LOCATION","103, 115, LOCATION","115, 122, MODAL","123, 128, ACTION","128, 160, CONTENT","188, 190, TRIGGER","203, 210, ACTION","210, 597, CONTENT","600, 612, LOCATION","624, 629, MODAL","634, 642, ACTION","647, 662, ACTION","663, 688, CONTENT","712, 726, LOCATION","165, 169, MODAL","833, 840, ACTION","811, 829, CONTENT"}
11814	Ø  Lines 20-50, the "Introduction" section. In its current form, the "Introduction" section contains 11 cited papers in less than a page (30 lines). I do not contradict the value of these papers, or their relevance in this context, but I consider that the article under review will benefit if the authors extend this section by analyzing appropriately the cited papers and citing  more other scientific papers. The purpose of the literature survey is to highlight exactly, for each of the involved referenced papers the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the method used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article. This is the only way to contextualize the current state of the art in which the authors of the manuscript position their paper and address aspects that have not been tackled/solved yet by the existing studies.	{"889, 897, ACTION","312, 409, CONTENT","899, 909, CONTENT","914, 921, ACTION","923, 991, CONTENT","305, 311, ACTION","290, 292, TRIGGER","238, 246, ACTION","232, 235, TRIGGER","277, 281, MODAL","232, 235, TRIGGER","281, 379, ACTION","3, 14, LOCATION","3, 14, LOCATION","20, 34, LOCATION","69, 83, LOCATION","853, 858, TRIGGER"}
11815	Ø  Line 50, at the final part of the "Introduction" section. After having performed a critical survey of what has been done up to this point in the scientific literature, the authors must identify a gap in the current state of knowledge that needs to be filled, a gap that is being addressed by their manuscript. This gap must also be used afterwards, in the "Discussion" section of the manuscript which is currently missing from the manuscript) as well, where the authors should justify why their approach fills the identified gap in rapport with previous studies from the literature.	{"455, 460, TRIGGER","3, 10, LOCATION","12, 59, LOCATION","183, 187, MODAL","61, 66, TRIGGER","187, 196, ACTION","197, 311, CONTENT","322, 326, MODAL","332, 339, ACTION","340, 397, CONTENT","398, 403, TRIGGER","407, 424, ACTION","430, 444, LOCATION","473, 479, MODAL","480, 487, ACTION","488, 584, CONTENT","183, 187, MODAL","3, 10, LOCATION","218, 223, ACTION","105, 109, TRIGGER"}

11817	Ø  Line 62, Scheme 1. This Scheme depicts "Schematic diagram of the semi-dry carbonation system for the CO2 capture". The scheme is interesting, but I consider that in addition to this figure, in order to help the readers better understand the methodology of the conducted research, the authors should devise a flowchart within the "Materials and Methods" section, a flowchart that depicts the steps that they have processed in developing their research and most important of all, the final target. This flowchart will facilitate the understanding of the proposed approach and in the same time will make the article more interesting  to the readers if used as a graphical abstract. Moreover, as requested by the Sustainability MDPI Journal's Template, the scheme should be renamed  as "Figure 1". The same issue must be addressed  in what concerns Scheme 2 (Line 137).	{"819, 829, ACTION","847, 857, LOCATION","858, 866, LOCATION","2, 10, LOCATION","145, 148, TRIGGER","295, 301, MODAL","518, 632, ACTION","3, 10, LOCATION","12, 20, LOCATION","42, 116, LOCATION","145, 148, TRIGGER","302, 308, ACTION","295, 301, MODAL","309, 498, CONTENT","498, 513, CONTENT","514, 518, MODAL","518, 529, ACTION","530, 681, CONTENT","682, 690, TRIGGER","763, 769, MODAL","773, 780, ACTION","785, 795, CONTENT","752, 762, LOCATION","797, 812, CONTENT","812, 816, MODAL"}
11818	Ø  Lines 111-113, the equations (1)-(3). All the equations within the manuscript should be explained , demonstrated or cited, as there are some equations that have not been introduced in the literature for the first time by the authors and that are not cited.

In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Discussion" section (which is currently missing from the manuscript), the authors should make a comparison between their approach from the manuscript and other similar ones that have been developed in the literature for the same or related purposes. I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their analysis and provide an insight at the end of the "Discussion" section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained results, the most important, appropriate and concrete actions that the decisional factors and all the involved parties should take in order to benefit from the results of the research conducted within the manuscript as to attain the ultimate goal of sustainability.	{"31, 38, ACTION","3, 27, CONTENT","31, 38, ACTION","185, 191, MODAL","192, 209, ACTION","209, 352, CONTENT","392, 394, TRIGGER","8, 18, LOCATION","462, 835, CONTENT","185, 191, MODAL","124, 129, TRIGGER","102, 123, CONTENT","379, 383, MODAL","453, 461, ACTION"}

11824	I have reviewed the manuscript "An Artificial Intelligence Solution for Electricity Procurement in Forward Markets", Manuscript ID: energies-1018713 that has been submitted for publication in the MDPI Energies Journal and I have identified a series of aspects that in my opinion must be addressed  in order to bring a benefit to the manuscript.	{"279, 283, MODAL","240, 264, CONTENT","287, 296, ACTION","279, 284, MODAL","117, 148, LOCATION","31, 115, LOCATION","20, 30, LOCATION","286, 296, ACTION"}
11825	In this paper, the authors present a solution to be deployed in the industry, aiming to solve the complex sequential decision-making problem behind the long-term electricity procurement task. As they have stated in the "Introduction" of the paper, the authors did not intend to improve the forecasts regarding the forward prices, but rather to enhance the entire decision-making process, finding ways to explain how to make relevant trading decisions based on imperfect information, including inaccurate forecasts. In this purpose, the authors introduce an algorithm providing recommendations to either buy electricity now or wait for a future opportunity based on the history of prices.	{"330, 333, TRIGGER","27, 34, ACTION","220, 232, LOCATION","218, 234, LOCATION","3, 13, LOCATION"}

11829	The Main Weak Point. I consider that the main weak point consists in the structure of the manuscript. If the authors make an effort to improve the structure of the manuscript and complement it with the recommendations from the specific comments, the authors will arrive at an article that can bring  a valuable insight to the current state of knowledge.	{"258, 262, MODAL","270, 352, CONTENT","69, 100, LOCATION","90, 100, LOCATION","292, 298, ACTION","258, 262, MODAL","102, 104, TRIGGER","117, 142, ACTION","143, 244, CONTENT","262, 269, ACTION"}

11831	Remark 1. In 2015, the European Commission (institution of the European Union, to whom Belgium is a member country since 1958) has adopted new electricity market rules in order to allow efficient EU-wide electricity trading and to bring the goal of a well-integrated EU internal energy market a step closer. The Regulation was published in the EU’s Official Journal on 25th July 2015 and entered into effect on 14th August 2015. The Regulation has created a comprehensive legal framework for electricity trading in Europe and has made so-called 'market coupling' legally binding across the EU. The Regulation is part of the Commission's project to create an Energy Union with a truly integrated electricity market. These rules establish a new decision-making procedure which enables effective regional cooperation among grid operators, power exchanges and regulators. I would like the authors to comment within their paper if/how their devised artificial intelligence solution for electricity procurement in forward markets can be integrated /used in order to comply/help complying to this European Regulation.	{"870, 875, MODAL","923, 929, TRIGGER","256, 266, ACTION","769, 774, TRIGGER","895, 903, ACTION","903, 922, LOCATION","929, 1110, CONTENT"}
11832	Remark 2. The sections of the manuscript. In the actual form of the paper, its sections are not according to the ones recommended by the Energies MDPI Journal's Template. The manuscript under review will benefit if it is restructured in accordance with the above-mentioned template that provides a more logical structure that is much more appropriate for a research article. The restructuring of the manuscript will also help the authors to express better the novelty of their work and the contribution that they have made to the current state of knowledge. Consequently, the manuscript under review should be restructured  as follows: Abstract, Keywords, 1. Introduction, 2. Materials and Methods, 3. Results, 4. Discussion, 5. Conclusions (not mandatory), 6. Patents (not mandatory), Supplementary Materials (not mandatory), Author Contributions, Funding, Acknowledgments, Conflicts of Interest, Appendices and References.	{"600, 606, MODAL","636, 924, CONTENT","610, 622, ACTION","572, 599, LOCATION","199, 203, MODAL","45, 73, LOCATION","557, 570, TRIGGER","449, 556, CONTENT","441, 448, ACTION","199, 203, MODAL","118, 129, ACTION","30, 40, LOCATION","421, 425, ACTION","411, 415, MODAL","374, 410, CONTENT","234, 374, CONTENT","220, 234, ACTION","212, 214, TRIGGER","171, 198, LOCATION","10, 40, LOCATION"}
11833	Remark 3. The "Literature review" section, Lines 60-92. In its current form, the "Literature review" section contains only 6 cited papers. I do not contradict the value of these papers, or their relevance in this context, but I consider that the literature review should be improved by performing a careful analysis of the cited  works and by analyzing more other papers. The authors must highlight exactly, for each of the involved referenced papers the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the method used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article. In addition to this, it will benefit the paper if the authors take into consideration more recent papers, in order to reflect the advancements in technology which took place over the last years, as in the actual form of the paper the cited papers focuses less on recent years. Actually, only 6 referenced papers are published in the last 5 years. I consider that the article under review will benefit if the authors extend this section by analyzing  more recent papers. By doing so, the authors will be able to contextualize the current state of the art in which they position their paper, to identify and address aspects that have not been tackled/solved yet by the existing body of knowledge.	{"1243, 1306, CONTENT","803, 993, CONTENT","273, 282, ACTION","264, 270, MODAL","242, 263, CONTENT","222, 225, TRIGGER","81, 101, LOCATION","43, 54, LOCATION","14, 33, LOCATION","283, 370, CONTENT","383, 388, MODAL","389, 398, ACTION","451, 716, CONTENT","765, 767, TRIGGER","779, 803, ACTION","1212, 1217, MODAL","1105, 1110, MODAL","742, 746, MODAL","1217, 1242, ACTION","1311, 1319, ACTION","1324, 1332, ACTION","1332, 1412, CONTENT","222, 225, TRIGGER","264, 270, MODAL","273, 328, ACTION","43, 54, LOCATION","1118, 1121, TRIGGER","1133, 1140, ACTION","1140, 1186, CONTENT"}
11834	Remark 4. The final part of the "Literature review" section, Lines 60-92. After having performed a critical survey of what has been done up to this point in the scientific literature, the authors must identify a gap in the current state of knowledge that needs to be filled, a gap that is being addressed by their manuscript. This gap must also be used afterwards, in the "Discussion" section of the manuscript as well, where the authors should justify why their approach fills the identified gap in rapport with previous studies from the literature.	{"32, 52, LOCATION","453, 549, CONTENT","445, 452, ACTION","211, 324, CONTENT","118, 122, TRIGGER","196, 200, MODAL","231, 236, ACTION","61, 72, LOCATION","437, 444, MODAL","420, 425, TRIGGER","372, 384, LOCATION","345, 363, ACTION","202, 209, ACTION","196, 200, MODAL","81, 182, CONTENT","74, 79, TRIGGER","335, 339, MODAL","61, 72, LOCATION"}
11835	Remark 5. The "Materials and Methods" section. It will benefit the paper if the authors restructure the actual content of section 2 into a "Materials and methods" section (eventually structured in subsections), in which the new developed methods are described in detail while well-established methods (and information) are briefly described and appropriately cited. I consider that the authors must pay more attention to the appropriate citation of the methods and results that have been retrieved from the scientific literature. When the authors present the information in the "Materials and Methods" section, they must assume clearly their original contribution by specifying this fact and by highlighting the fact that starting  from a certain point there are depicted the original and novel aspects of their research.	{"50, 54, MODAL","13, 38, LOCATION","73, 75, TRIGGER","88, 99, ACTION","122, 131, LOCATION","131, 209, CONTENT","214, 219, TRIGGER","219, 245, CONTENT","250, 259, ACTION","270, 275, TRIGGER","276, 318, CONTENT","323, 340, ACTION","345, 364, ACTION","394, 398, MODAL","399, 417, ACTION","420, 528, CONTENT","530, 534, TRIGGER","535, 609, CONTENT","615, 620, MODAL","621, 635, ACTION","635, 663, CONTENT","667, 677, ACTION","695, 707, ACTION","678, 687, CONTENT","709, 820, CONTENT","122, 131, LOCATION","250, 259, ACTION","50, 54, MODAL","214, 219, TRIGGER"}
11836	Remark 6. The flowchart. In order to help the readers better understand the methodology of the conducted study, in the "Materials and Methods" section the authors should devise a flowchart that depicts the steps that they have processed in developing  their research and most important of all, the final target. This flowchart will facilitate the understanding of the proposed approach and at the same time will make the article more interesting  to the readers if used as a graphical abstract.	{"312, 326, CONTENT","170, 177, ACTION","163, 169, MODAL","119, 143, LOCATION","10, 23, LOCATION","485, 493, LOCATION","169, 250, ACTION","327, 331, MODAL","342, 494, CONTENT","332, 342, ACTION","326, 332, MODAL","177, 311, CONTENT"}

At Lines 286-287, the authors state: " In this research paper, the performance of a procurement strategy is evaluated on a case study consisting of CAL products over a period of eight years, ranging from CAL 2012 to CAL 2019."  The authors must provide more details regarding the preprocessing approach that they have used and the way in which they intend to solve the problems related to missing  data or abnormal values if they are to occur.	{"305, 312, ACTION","299, 304, MODAL","97, 286, LOCATION","398, 403, TRIGGER","90, 95, ACTION","63, 76, LOCATION","313, 503, CONTENT","14, 50, LOCATION","63, 76, LOCATION"}
11839	Remark 9. The "DL forecaster" section. At Line 265, the authors state: "The training of this DNN is performed with the ADAM optimizer…" As the authors have used an Artificial Neural Network approach, I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors present more details regarding the results obtained during  various tests, for different training algorithms, for all the different number of neurons and epochs tested and especially the training time for each test, until they have obtained the configuration that has provided the best results. The information can be summarized  in a table and if it becomes too long, the authors can restrict it in the paper to ten main experimental runs, and a complete table with all the experimental runs must be inserted  in the Supplementary Materials file of the article.	{"261, 547, CONTENT","239, 241, TRIGGER","42, 50, LOCATION","13, 30, LOCATION","226, 230, MODAL","565, 568, MODAL","64, 69, ACTION","42, 50, LOCATION","135, 138, TRIGGER","71, 135, LOCATION","583, 815, CONTENT","572, 582, ACTION","564, 568, MODAL","549, 564, CONTENT","254, 261, ACTION"}

11841	Remark 11. The "Discussion" section. In order to validate the usefulness of their research, in the "Discussion" section, the authors should make a detailed comparison between their approach from the manuscript and other similar ones that have been developed and used in the literature for the same or related purposes. Even if in this section the authors have inserted a citation (namely [12]), this citation (of a website) is used in order to sustain and justify the statements from the manuscript under review, but not in the purpose of devising a comparison between the authors' obtained results/devised approach and other existing ones from the literature. There are a lot of valuable studies in the scientific literature related to the subject of the manuscript to which the authors can compare to and this comparison will highlight even more the novel aspects that their paper brought in contrast to the existing   studies. In the actual form of the paper, the discussion section does not contain enough details in order to highlight the advantages of the developed approach in contrast to the existing ones from the literature.	{"806, 822, CONTENT","792, 802, ACTION","513, 516, TRIGGER","16, 26, LOCATION","788, 791, MODAL","770, 775, TRIGGER","671, 766, CONTENT","395, 408, LOCATION","381, 392, LOCATION","146, 317, CONTENT","140, 144, ACTION","133, 139, MODAL","15, 27, LOCATION","99, 111, LOCATION","262, 266, ACTION","1003, 1134, CONTENT","991, 1002, ACTION","964, 985, LOCATION","934, 961, LOCATION","848, 928, CONTENT","319, 326, TRIGGER","133, 139, MODAL","828, 837, ACTION","823, 828, MODAL"}

I consider that the paper will benefit if the authors make a step further, beyond their analysis and provide an insight at the end of the "Discussion" section regarding what they consider to be, based on the obtained results, the most important, appropriate and concrete actions that the decisional factors and all the involved parties should take in order to benefit from the results of the research conducted within the manuscript.	{"206, 210, TRIGGER","15, 27, LOCATION","76, 78, TRIGGER","137, 145, ACTION","146, 156, CONTENT","160, 195, LOCATION","206, 470, CONTENT","62, 67, MODAL","63, 67, MODAL","16, 26, LOCATION"}
11844	Remark 14. The "Discussion" section.

11848	I have reviewed the manuscript "Winds of change: how up-to-date forecasting methods could help change Brazilian wind energy policy and save billions of US$", Manuscript ID: energies-369139 that has been submitted for publication in the MDPI Energies Journal and I have identified a series of aspects that in my opinion must be addressed  in order to bring a benefit to the manuscript:	{"158, 188, LOCATION","49, 52, TRIGGER","84, 89, MODAL","326, 336, ACTION","20, 30, LOCATION","338, 346, TRIGGER","280, 299, CONTENT","326, 336, ACTION","319, 323, MODAL","31, 156, LOCATION"}
11849	In this paper, the authors propose a revaluation of the Brazilian wind energy policy framework and the energy auction requirements. The authors state that the motivation of their study is the fact that the Brazilian wind policy, cross-checked against other countries policies, showed to be too restrictive and outdated. Therefore, the authors propose the renewal of the Brazilian wind policy, through the adoption of international standards by Brazilian policy-makers, reducing the wind time sampling necessary to implement wind farms. In order to support these policy change, the authors develop a wind forecasting method based on fuzzy time series shaped with a statistical significance approach.	{"3, 14, LOCATION","320, 329, TRIGGER","144, 149, ACTION","616, 622, LOCATION"}

12162	Rather than presenting quantitative data similar to those presented in abstract, go further in findings, clarifying statements such as“It is shown that different energy mix scenarios will give different results for SPECCA.

A case specific evaluation, considering local conditions such as electricity mix and availability of waste heat, and practical constraints such as available space and capacity of local electricity grid, is required to identify the best capture technology for a given cement plant.” To me, the way authors end:“no clear winner can be pointed  out among the technologies” is not relevant nor enlightening towards the so called comparison between technologies intended to be made at the beginning: “Comparison of technologies for CO2 capture from cement production – Part 1”.	{"693, 761, CONTENT","224, 227, MODAL","21, 35, ACTION","763, 840, LOCATION","179, 187, ACTION","577, 637, LOCATION","47, 549, LOCATION","638, 653, ACTION","654, 658, TRIGGER","658, 670, ACTION","47, 549, LOCATION"}

12187	As always, I have difficulty in understanding the“listing” of mathematical equations one after the other in an international journal intending the subject to clearly link the scope of the text (this is not a mathematical journal).

12192	In my perspective, supplementary material cannot be analysed  in the text. There is no such thing.

12210	A succession of similar data, either equations, tables or figures does not contribute to a relevant text. That is why to publish is more difficult that to do experiments.

Also, I find it difficult to connect the extensive mathematical deduction (which in part can be transported  to supplementary material) to the subject to which is it applied in order for the text to be published in a journal like Energies and be considered relevant in this area. This is not a mathematical journal, so the mathematical data, must lose some importance and authors must considered to better develop the text as a whole.	{"201, 238, CONTENT","161, 172, ACTION","39, 44, ACTION","45, 63, CONTENT","154, 157, MODAL","140, 145, TRIGGER","464, 498, CONTENT","449, 460, ACTION","417, 432, CONTENT","411, 416, ACTION","388, 405, CONTENT","154, 157, MODAL","177, 199, LOCATION","106, 138, CONTENT","81, 101, ACTION","407, 411, MODAL","65, 69, TRIGGER","28, 38, LOCATION","8, 16, CONTENT","0, 7, TRIGGER","140, 145, TRIGGER","445, 449, MODAL","160, 172, ACTION","28, 38, LOCATION"}

13016	At a certain point the author states “The approach in this paper is thus specified: Base Case Modeling of a hypothetical CBM Field; depreciation method analysis, incentives sensitivity analysis – factor analysis, and parameter sensitivity analysis.

13026	Previous to tables, text must be inclusive, readers do not have the job to interpret.	{"25, 29, MODAL","25, 29, MODAL","12, 18, LOCATION","20, 25, LOCATION","33, 42, ACTION","0, 18, CONTENT"}
13027	The fact that we may be analysing  a long manuscript, with a significant amount of data makes sense, when everything links together, and that is also whey manuscripts are getting smaller, assertive and more concise than ever. It is possible to see that in this section, as previously, this could be considered  a draft. The manuscript needs to be worked in order to make sense and be formally correct.	{"354, 365, TRIGGER","366, 400, CONTENT","290, 295, MODAL","298, 309, ACTION","324, 334, LOCATION","335, 340, MODAL","347, 353, ACTION","311, 318, CONTENT","42, 52, LOCATION","256, 268, LOCATION","101, 105, TRIGGER","290, 295, MODAL","20, 33, ACTION"}
13028	When referring to supplementary material, authors must not directly refer to tables numbers and content. At the most, state that supplementary data is available, because you are in fact analysing data presented elsewhere… through this part of the text.	{"18, 31, LOCATION","5, 14, ACTION","50, 54, MODAL","77, 103, CONTENT","118, 123, ACTION","129, 160, CONTENT","18, 40, LOCATION","50, 58, MODAL","68, 73, ACTION"}

13030	The way the author writes makes it difficult to have a final assertive text, according to all previous comments. I believe that will reflect in the entire text.	{"71, 75, LOCATION","128, 132, MODAL","133, 140, ACTION","148, 159, LOCATION","0, 75, CONTENT","128, 133, MODAL"}
13031	As it is the text is very disperse and difficult to read, in order to acknowledge the importance of the subject under analysis… A complete revision is necessary.	{"70, 81, ACTION","58, 69, MODAL","139, 147, ACTION","13, 17, LOCATION","18, 56, ACTION","86, 126, CONTENT","13, 17, LOCATION"}
13032	References are outdated… and scarce… That compromises the manuscript relevance.	{"58, 68, LOCATION","11, 23, ACTION","0, 10, CONTENT","29, 35, ACTION","42, 53, ACTION","58, 78, CONTENT"}
13034	Suggested change: use singular, rather than plural“Berea Sandstones” Looking at the text, it is usually in singular.	{"50, 68, LOCATION","18, 21, ACTION","32, 43, TRIGGER","50, 68, LOCATION","18, 21, ACTION","44, 50, CONTENT","22, 30, CONTENT","84, 88, LOCATION"}
13035	See that the term“Mechanistic” is used ONCE in the entire text…	{"31, 43, ACTION","51, 62, LOCATION","17, 30, LOCATION","34, 38, ACTION","13, 17, CONTENT","17, 30, LOCATION"}
13036	The same with“Flooding Recovery”	{"4, 8, ACTION","13, 32, LOCATION","13, 32, LOCATION"}

13038	Instead of justifying the study and state what was done, authors should focus in briefly present a statement regarding  the important of the subject and clearly enlighten the findings, which are only superficially mentioned at the very end without further emphasis. No quantitative data expressed.	{"266, 286, CONTENT","196, 264, CONTENT","161, 170, ACTION","77, 148, CONTENT","72, 77, ACTION","11, 55, CONTENT","287, 296, ACTION","99, 108, LOCATION","185, 190, TRIGGER","42, 46, TRIGGER","174, 183, CONTENT","11, 21, ACTION","0, 10, TRIGGER","65, 71, MODAL"}

13041	Keywords: Avoid using abbreviations alone (which may apply to very different subjects) and see that mentioned terms in the title are not present here. Obvious case is	{"43, 48, TRIGGER","123, 128, LOCATION","10, 15, ACTION","49, 52, MODAL","43, 48, TRIGGER","0, 8, LOCATION","10, 15, ACTION","49, 53, MODAL","53, 58, ACTION","91, 94, ACTION","100, 115, CONTENT","123, 128, LOCATION","145, 149, LOCATION","59, 85, CONTENT","16, 41, CONTENT","129, 144, ACTION"}
13042	Do not use unclear expressions such as“is more than needed”. Search the entire text.	{"0, 10, ACTION","61, 67, ACTION","72, 83, LOCATION","7, 10, ACTION","38, 59, LOCATION","11, 30, CONTENT","38, 59, LOCATION"}
13043	The scarcity of references can be reflected  in the second paragraph pf the Introduction where there is a long text and one reference at the end. That is not the correct way to write the state of the art…	{"33, 43, ACTION","27, 30, MODAL","59, 68, LOCATION","89, 94, TRIGGER","154, 169, ACTION","106, 143, CONTENT","51, 88, LOCATION","0, 26, CONTENT","170, 203, CONTENT","27, 30, MODAL","34, 44, ACTION"}
13044	See that in a direct citation, authors must add the number immediately, not at the end:“Hower [2] conducted”: See the whole text. The same happens later on.	{"87, 108, CONTENT","110, 113, ACTION","118, 128, LOCATION","52, 70, CONTENT","43, 47, ACTION","39, 43, MODAL","14, 29, CONTENT","0, 3, ACTION","87, 108, LOCATION","39, 47, ACTION"}

13047	I am not in favour of an extensive number of headings which cut the text into pieces and break continuity: 2.1.1. to 2.1.3. headings could be removed . The same after	{"25, 53, CONTENT","60, 105, CONTENT","107, 113, LOCATION","133, 138, MODAL","117, 123, LOCATION","68, 72, LOCATION","141, 149, ACTION","54, 59, TRIGGER","142, 149, ACTION","54, 59, TRIGGER"}

13059	Why the “-“ at“10000-ppm” and more?	{"8, 11, LOCATION","0, 3, TRIGGER","14, 25, LOCATION","14, 25, LOCATION"}
13060	Figure 6: a % is already a magnitude.

13063	There are more assertive ways to say the same:“This trend leads us to think that the gradual increase in the salinity concentration facilitates the release of more light or heavy oil.” Revise.	{"46, 184, LOCATION","46, 184, LOCATION","185, 191, ACTION"}

13065	I would suggest revising  this section in order to clearly emphasize the quantitative data presented before, and then move forward to statements of this kind“the concentration of 0.2 wt% was the only one that exhibited” which allow to move closer to the real findings… Statements like“The application of a positive salinity gradient for the remobilization of light and heavy oils realized the best recovery results. Furthermore, the additional oil recovered after surfactant flooding was also higher.” Never mean a lot when they are not supported by data, presented at the same time	{"59, 68, ACTION","69, 107, CONTENT","226, 267, CONTENT","529, 546, ACTION","157, 219, LOCATION","220, 225, TRIGGER","157, 219, LOCATION","7, 24, ACTION","220, 225, TRIGGER","284, 501, LOCATION","2, 7, MODAL","39, 50, MODAL","16, 24, ACTION","550, 554, CONTENT","26, 38, LOCATION","269, 279, CONTENT","118, 130, ACTION","134, 144, CONTENT"}

13821	I understand the intention of the manuscript and find it relevant and enlightening. However, after formal issues are addressed, commented earlier, I believe the authors must carefully look at the structure presented in sections e and 4, so that abstract and conclusions may arise as a reflection of a fluid and cohesive text.	{"170, 174, MODAL","35, 45, LOCATION","84, 91, TRIGGER","33, 44, LOCATION","169, 173, MODAL","184, 188, ACTION","219, 235, LOCATION","270, 273, MODAL","274, 279, ACTION","280, 324, CONTENT","196, 215, CONTENT","237, 244, TRIGGER","245, 254, LOCATION","258, 270, LOCATION","85, 92, TRIGGER","207, 216, ACTION"}
13822	In conclusions I would initially also add a brief contextualization to“defend” the need to present the study and add more quantitative data to findings.	{"17, 22, MODAL","38, 41, ACTION","3, 15, LOCATION","70, 78, LOCATION","17, 23, MODAL","38, 42, ACTION","113, 117, ACTION","117, 151, CONTENT","42, 108, CONTENT"}

13826	Abstract: The abstract needs to be clear in terms of results and findings, namely explicitly clarifying meaning and ranges, namely in terms of index and quantitative data.	{"41, 73, CONTENT","104, 122, CONTENT","14, 23, LOCATION","0, 8, LOCATION","131, 170, CONTENT","124, 131, TRIGGER","14, 22, LOCATION","32, 40, ACTION","93, 103, ACTION","23, 29, MODAL","75, 82, TRIGGER"}

13829	Consider revising the way references are presented in the text, there are times when direct referencing style would also be considered not just at the end… “[]”	{"80, 84, TRIGGER","9, 50, CONTENT","0, 8, ACTION","156, 160, LOCATION","144, 154, LOCATION","135, 143, TRIGGER","116, 121, TRIGGER","110, 115, MODAL","64, 109, CONTENT","58, 62, LOCATION","58, 62, LOCATION","124, 134, ACTION","41, 50, ACTION","110, 115, MODAL"}

13835	Outside introduction and literature sections the use of references must be made with care, usually mentioning authors names.	{"67, 71, MODAL","49, 52, ACTION","8, 20, LOCATION","25, 44, LOCATION","75, 89, ACTION","91, 123, CONTENT","21, 25, TRIGGER","0, 20, LOCATION","67, 72, MODAL","49, 66, CONTENT"}

13846	To me mathematical data must be presented  (and removed from table using both definition and formula at the same time…) otherwise, as equations (and numbered, au usually…), and terms (parameters) defined and units presented, where available	{"120, 129, TRIGGER","67, 117, CONTENT","24, 28, MODAL","31, 41, ACTION","44, 48, TRIGGER","61, 67, LOCATION","231, 240, CONTENT","24, 29, MODAL","32, 43, ACTION","48, 56, ACTION","225, 230, TRIGGER","6, 23, CONTENT","131, 195, CONTENT","196, 204, ACTION","208, 214, CONTENT","214, 223, ACTION","225, 231, TRIGGER"}
