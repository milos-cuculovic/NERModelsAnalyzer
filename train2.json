The context of the work should be set first. What scientific problems and questions the work try to address?3. The scale bars on the SEM images should be visible. The resolution is too low to be able to see what length the scale bar actually represents.4. Reproducibility should be discussed . Were the catalysts prepared and tested several times? Standard deviations for the obtained data should be presented where possible, in particular Figures 9-10 where the CO conversion is presented.5. Closely related work on CO oxidation should be mentioned  in the introduction such as 10.3390/catal9030256; 10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.10.015; 10.1021/jacs.7b13624 (DOI).6. CO oxidation (in particular at low temperature) is pivotal to the abatement of exhaust gases and therefore ties in well with the increasingly important sustainability efforts in catalysis. A general paragraph on sustainability should be added  to the introduction. Briefly mention the different fields of sustainable solutions via catalysis such as biorefinery (10.1039/C8GC04017F), organocatalysis (10.1021/acscatal.8b01706), waste valorization (10.1039/C9GC00902G), hydrogen evolution (10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b05302), natural laterite (10.1021/acsanm.8b01117).7. The catalysts were washed with isopropanol. The amount expressed as \u201cL solvent per kg catalyst\u201d should be explicitly given under the experimental section. The scale of catalyst fabrication should also be revealed as currently the exact amounts are not disclosed under section 4.1.8. The recovery and reusability of the catalysts should be discussed  in the text. Have the authors performed any repeated experiments on used catalysts? Have they observed any performance decline? What are the criteria for reusing the catalysts? What is the expected lifetime of the catalysts?9. In order to minimize waste and address the sustainability requirements, the authors should mention that the isopropanol could be recycled  using sustainable membrane technologies (solvent recycling) and mention 10.1016/j.jcat.2019.01.041 example.10.

{"text": "\u00d8 Lines 12-21, the 'Introduction' section. 'Over the years, a class of hybrid EAs, called memetic algorithms (MAs), have been widely applied for many complex optimization problems, such as scheduling problems [1\u20133], combinatorial optimization problems [4\u20136], multi-objective optimization problems [7,8] and multimodal optimization problems [9,10]. Population based evolutionary approaches, such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs) or Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), are able to detect in a fast way the main regions of attraction while their local search abilities represent a major drawback [11] from the point of view of the solution accuracy and of the convergence behaviour, specially when applied to multimodal problems. Memetic Algorithms (MAs) [12] have recently received a great attention as effective meta-heuristics to improve generic Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) schemes by combining these latter with local search procedures [11,13].' I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 13 (like the authors have did) or even more scientific works in a few lines just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section. In this section, the authors must introduce a presentation of\u00a0the current state of the research field by reviewing it carefully and by citing key publications. By doing so, the problem will be put into context and it will benefit the readers as well. The purpose of the literature survey is to highlight for each of the involved referenced papers the main contribution that the authors of the referenced papers have brought to the current state of knowledge, the method used by the authors of the referenced papers, a brief presentation of the main obtained results and some limitations of the referenced article.

{"text": "Remarks regarding the 'Introduction' section. 'Using time-series information is theoretically a neural network that expands over time [16]-[22]. Unfortunately, when the time distance increases, RNN will become unable to connect related information, so the LSTM network (Long Short -Term Memory networks) is proposed, which is a special form of RNN, and is characterized by being able to learn long-distance dependencies. Used in other different fields [23]-[25], first proposed by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997) [26], this experimental data is a chaotic time series, which is closely related to time in prediction. LSTM has been widely applied in many field, especially in time series modeling, including speech recognition, natural language processing and sequence prediction [27]-[28].'

' Despite the UCE pilot\u2019s success in terms of emissions reductions and participation, analysis of participants\u2019 demographic data indicates that participants in the UCE pilot were not representative of the ethnic and income demographics of the target ZIP Codes. Several factors may have contributed to this result, including: the distance of UCE pilot event locations from public transit, the lack of culturally relevant messaging, the lack of Spanish-speaking staff at events, and the lack of trusted messengers participating in events. To address the lack of demographic representation among participants, subsequent expansion efforts should include more direct engagement with trusted members of the targeted communities and stronger attempts to engage participants in energy efficiency education.'. It is beneficial for this study the fact that the authors have admitted their failure to attract demographically representative participants in their study, have analyzed possible reasons that have caused and potential ways to address this lack in the future, but I consider that the authors must explain if this failure did not affect the relevance of their study.

{"text": "Lines 29-73, the 'Introduction' section. In its current form, the 'Introduction' section contains a series of cited papers. I do not contradict the value of these papers, or their relevance in this context, but I consider that the article under review will benefit if the authors extend this section by analyzing appropriately the cited papers and by analyzing  more other papers in order to contextualize their study. The literature review of the cited papers has been performed in the following manner: 'The induction motors (IMs) account for 80% of industrial motors because of its simple structure and low manufacture cost [7-9]. However, IMs have the secondary copper loss which is typically 25% of the total loss [10]. This secondary copper loss limits the efficiency improvement of IMs. Therefore, in order to replace IMs, new types of motor are being studied to improve the efficiency [11-14]. Synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) receive the attention as the alternative to IMs because SynRM don\u2019t have the secondary copper loss [11, 15]. Moreover, because of a greater saliency ratio, SynRM can produce a large reluctance torque when using  a variable speed drive or electronic controller [10, 16-18]. [\u2026] For this reason, line start synchronous reluctance motor (LS-SynRM) has received attention that it can operate at synchronous speed without the inverter [19-21].' (Lines 42-53).

One of the most important aspects that must be mentioned is the fact that the authors have documented  their research but there are some issues regarding the citations. In some cases, the authors have not written the information with their own words in the manuscript under review. Therefore, in the actual form of the manuscript, some paragraphs are almost identical to ones from other papers, for example on the first page, the authors state: 'Theory of convexity plays a strong role in the field of fractional integral inequalities due to the behavior of its definition. There is a strong relationship between convexity and symmetry theories. Whichever one we work on, we can apply it to the other one due the strong correlation produced between them, especially in the past few years.' This sentence can be found in an almost identical form in the paper 'Mohammed, P.O.; Brevik, I. A New Version of the Hermite\u2013Hadamard Inequality for Riemann\u2013Liouville Fractional Integrals. Symmetry 2020, 12, 610.' ('The concept of convexity plays a strong role in the field of inequalities due to the behavior of its definition.
