Authors answered this issue but they did not specify it in their manuscript. Such choice is a very important bias, as the choice is neither random nor based on any criteria.

'Over the years, a class of hybrid EAs, called memetic algorithms (MAs), have been widely applied for many complex optimization problems, such as scheduling problems [1\u20133], combinatorial optimization problems [4\u20136], multi-objective optimization problems [7,8] and multimodal optimization problems [9,10]. Population based evolutionary approaches, such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs) or Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), are able to detect in a fast way the main regions of attraction while their local search abilities represent a major drawback [11] from the point of view of the solution accuracy and of the convergence behaviour, specially when applied to multimodal problems. Memetic Algorithms (MAs) [12] have recently received a great attention as effective meta-heuristics to improve generic Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) schemes by combining these latter with local search procedures [11,13].'

Unfortunately, when the time distance increases, RNN will become unable to connect related information, so the LSTM network (Long Short -Term Memory networks) is proposed, which is a special form of RNN, and is characterized by being able to learn long-distance dependencies. Used in other different fields [23]-[25], first proposed by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997) [26], this experimental data is a chaotic time series, which is closely related to time in prediction. LSTM has been widely applied in many field, especially in time series modeling, including speech recognition, natural language processing and sequence prediction [27]-[28].'

On the basis of load characteristics\u2019 analysis for e-bus charging station, FC is adopted to extract samples on similar days, which can not only avoid the blindness of selecting  similar days by experience, but also overcome the adverse effects of unconventional load data caused by sudden change of factors on training. Then, the author employs WPA with good global convergence and computational robustness in order to optimize the parameters of LSSVM. Consequently, in the paper is developed a hybrid load forecasting model for quick-change e-bus charging station, namely FC-WPA-LSSVM. In order to verify the developed model, the author uses for model construction and testing two case studies.

'Software trustworthiness is the ability of software to satisfy user expectation with its behaviors and results and to still provide continuous services by disturbances [1].

Software trustworthiness measurement describes how to determine the trustworthy degree of software based on the given trustworthy attributes\u2019 values and their weight values. It can provide a basis for guiding and improving  the trustworthiness of design and implementation of software. Therefore, software trustworthiness measurement becomes one of the core scientific problems in the researching on software trustworthiness [1]. Many software trustworthiness measures based on trustworthy attributes are established, including questionnaires and statistical analysis [8,9], axiomatic approaches [10\u201316], evidence theory [17], supervised machine learning [18], maximum entropy and grey decision-making method [19], software behaviour entropy [20], system testing [21], social-to-software framework [22], crowd wisdom [23], heuristic-systematic processing model [24], users feedback [25], STRAM (Security, Trust, Resilience, and Agility Metrics) [26], etc.' I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 26 (like the authors have did) or even more scientific works in a few lines just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section.

The literature review of the cited papers has been performed in the following manner: 'The induction motors (IMs) account for 80% of industrial motors because of its simple structure and low manufacture cost [7-9]. However, IMs have the secondary copper loss which is typically 25% of the total loss [10]. This secondary copper loss limits the efficiency improvement of IMs. Therefore, in order to replace IMs, new types of motor are being studied to improve the efficiency [11-14]. Synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) receive the attention as the alternative to IMs because SynRM don\u2019t have the secondary copper loss [11, 15]. Moreover, because of a greater saliency ratio, SynRM can produce a large reluctance torque when using  a variable speed drive or electronic controller [10, 16-18]. [\u2026] For this reason, line start synchronous reluctance motor (LS-SynRM) has received attention that it can operate at synchronous speed without the inverter [19-21].' (Lines 42-53).

They are not efficient and produce considerable amounts of impurities and pollutants which have a negative effect on the environment [4,5]. [\u2026] They do not reduce emission of pollutants generated by technological systems of heat sources [6,7]. [\u2026] Solutions with recuperators can include devices installed as separate elements of the technological system of the heat source [8\u201311] or devices which constitute an integral part of the combustion chamber, e.g., in condensing boilers [11,12]. Recently, systems with compressor or sorption heat pumps for the recovery and reuse of waste heat have been used most frequently [13,14]. An interesting concept of using an adsorption heat pump for reusing the heat generated by a district heating system in the summer period, when the heat is treated as waste heat, was discussed in [15]. However, the solutions for heat recovery with the use of recuperators and/or heat pumps do not in any way affect changes in the combustion gas composition, thus they do not contribute to the reduction of environmental burden caused by heat sources. This is a serious disadvantage of these solutions in comparison to the installation described herein, which enhances energy efficiency of boilers and reduces emission of pollutants and impurities, including solid impurities. Methods of improving control systems in heating boilers are also often applied in order to enhance energy efficiency of heat sources [16\u201319].
