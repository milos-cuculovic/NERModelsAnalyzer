Authors answered this issue but they did not specify it in their manuscript. Such choice is a very important bias, as the choice is neither random nor based on any criteria.

{"text": "1. The abstract should have a single sentence to introduce the research motivation from a broad perspective.2. The introduction starts in medias res. The context of the work should be set first. What scientific problems and questions the work try to address?3. The scale bars on the SEM images should be visible. The resolution is too low to be able to see what length the scale bar actually represents.4. Reproducibility should be discussed . Were the catalysts prepared and tested several times? Standard deviations for the obtained data should be presented where possible, in particular Figures 9-10 where the CO conversion is presented.5. Closely related work on CO oxidation should be mentioned  in the introduction such as 10.3390/catal9030256; 10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.10.015; 10.1021/jacs.7b13624 (DOI).6. CO oxidation (in particular at low temperature) is pivotal to the abatement of exhaust gases and therefore ties in well with the increasingly important sustainability efforts in catalysis. A general paragraph on sustainability should be added  to the introduction. Briefly mention the different fields of sustainable solutions via catalysis such as biorefinery (10.1039/C8GC04017F), organocatalysis (10.1021/acscatal.8b01706), waste valorization (10.1039/C9GC00902G), hydrogen evolution (10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b05302), natural laterite (10.1021/acsanm.8b01117).7. The catalysts were washed with isopropanol. The amount expressed as \u201cL solvent per kg catalyst\u201d should be explicitly given under the experimental section. The scale of catalyst fabrication should also be revealed as currently the exact amounts are not disclosed under section 4.1.8. The recovery and reusability of the catalysts should be discussed  in the text. Have the authors performed any repeated experiments on used catalysts? Have they observed any performance decline? What are the criteria for reusing the catalysts? What is the expected lifetime of the catalysts?9. In order to minimize waste and address the sustainability requirements, the authors should mention that the isopropanol could be recycled  using sustainable membrane technologies (solvent recycling) and mention 10.1016/j.jcat.2019.01.041 example.10. The conclusion section should briefly mention the main limitations and drawbacks of the proposed catalysts, as well as the novelty of the presented work in relation to the existing literature.11.

According to the MDPI Mathematics Journal's Template, it is recommended that a research paper contain, among other sections, a 'Materials and Methods' one. In the actual form of the manuscript this section is partially replaced by the actual sections 2 and 3. The authors should take into consideration to restructure these sections in order to provide the details required by the 'Materials and Methods' section, as recommended by the Journal's Template. In the 'Materials and Methods' section, the new developed methods should be described  in detail while well-established methods (and information) can be briefly described and appropriately cited . In order to help the readers better understand the methodology of the conducted study, in the 'Materials and Methods' section, the authors should devise a flowchart that depicts the steps that they have processed in developing  their research and most important of all, the final target. This flowchart will facilitate the understanding of the proposed approach and in the same time will make the article more interesting  to the readers if used as a graphical abstract. In addition to flowchart, in order to bring a benefit to the manuscript, the authors should state and justify very clear in the 'Materials and Methods' section the choices they have made when developing the final form of their proposed approach. The authors should state what has justified using  this approach, what is special, unexpected, or different in their research methodology.

Using a state-of-the-art mobile observation platform that includes instrumentation mounted on light rail trains (Mitchell et al., 2018) and a news helicopter (Blaylock, Horel, & Crosman, 2017), large spatial and temporal gradients in pollutant concentrations have been observed across Salt Lake County. The health impacts of poor air quality in Utah range from high incidences of pneumonia (Pirozzi et al., 2018), to increased hospitalizations due to respiratory issues (Horne et al., 2018). Furthermore, emerging associations between poor air quality and negative health outcomes such as pre-term births (Hackmann & Sj\u00f6berg, 2016) and suicides (Bakian et al., 2015) have been found in the Salt Lake Valley and Utah, furthering the importance of pollutant reduction strategies.'

Several factors may have contributed to this result, including: the distance of UCE pilot event locations from public transit, the lack of culturally relevant messaging, the lack of Spanish-speaking staff at events, and the lack of trusted messengers participating in events. To address the lack of demographic representation among participants, subsequent expansion efforts should include more direct engagement with trusted members of the targeted communities and stronger attempts to engage participants in energy efficiency education.'.

I do not contradict the value of these papers, or their relevance in this context, but I consider that the article under review will benefit if the authors extend this section by analyzing appropriately the cited papers and by analyzing  more other papers in order to contextualize their study. The literature review of the cited papers has been performed mostly in the following manner: 'Membrane separation is another method has been used for natural gas sweetening [7-10]. Other methods include but are not limited to biochemical method [11], molecular sieving [12,13], and low-temperature fractionation [14,15]. Among those technologies listed above, chemical absorption is the most widely used method for acid gas removal. Various amines have been commonly used as chemical solvents, such as monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), and methyldiethanolamine (MDEA). Compared with MEA and DEA, MDEA can selectively remove H2S with the existence of CO2. Secondly, MDEA can remove most CO2 and H2S from the raw natural gas, it can be beneficial to sulfur recovery. Thirdly, the foaming tendency and corrosiveness of MDEA are lower compared to MEA and DEA. Last but not least, the reaction of MDEA with CO2 is an acid-base reaction with less heat of reaction, thus less heat is needed during regeneration, so it is ideal for removing CO2 in large quantities [16-18].'.

The literature review of the cited papers has been performed in the following manner: 'The induction motors (IMs) account for 80% of industrial motors because of its simple structure and low manufacture cost [7-9]. However, IMs have the secondary copper loss which is typically 25% of the total loss [10]. This secondary copper loss limits the efficiency improvement of IMs. Therefore, in order to replace IMs, new types of motor are being studied to improve the efficiency [11-14]. Synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) receive the attention as the alternative to IMs because SynRM don\u2019t have the secondary copper loss [11, 15]. Moreover, because of a greater saliency ratio, SynRM can produce a large reluctance torque when using  a variable speed drive or electronic controller [10, 16-18]. [\u2026] For this reason, line start synchronous reluctance motor (LS-SynRM) has received attention that it can operate at synchronous speed without the inverter [19-21].' (Lines 42-53).
