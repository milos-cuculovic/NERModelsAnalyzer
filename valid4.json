Used in other different fields [23]-[25], first proposed by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997) [26], this experimental data is a chaotic time series, which is closely related to time in prediction. LSTM has been widely applied in many field, especially in time series modeling, including speech recognition, natural language processing and sequence prediction [27]-[28].'
