The resolution is too low to be able to see what length the scale bar actually represents.4. Reproducibility should be discussed . Were the catalysts prepared and tested several times? Standard deviations for the obtained data should be presented where possible, in particular Figures 9-10 where the CO conversion is presented.5. Closely related work on CO oxidation should be mentioned  in the introduction such as 10.3390/catal9030256; 10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.10.015; 10.1021/jacs.7b13624 (DOI).6. CO oxidation (in particular at low temperature) is pivotal to the abatement of exhaust gases and therefore ties in well with the increasingly important sustainability efforts in catalysis. A general paragraph on sustainability should be added  to the introduction. Briefly mention the different fields of sustainable solutions via catalysis such as biorefinery (10.1039/C8GC04017F), organocatalysis (10.1021/acscatal.8b01706), waste valorization (10.1039/C9GC00902G), hydrogen evolution (10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b05302), natural laterite (10.1021/acsanm.8b01117).7. The catalysts were washed with isopropanol. The amount expressed as \u201cL solvent per kg catalyst\u201d should be explicitly given under the experimental section. The scale of catalyst fabrication should also be revealed as currently the exact amounts are not disclosed under section 4.1.8. The recovery and reusability of the catalysts should be discussed  in the text. Have the authors performed any repeated experiments on used catalysts? Have they observed any performance decline? What are the criteria for reusing the catalysts? What is the expected lifetime of the catalysts?9. In order to minimize waste and address the sustainability requirements, the authors should mention that the isopropanol could be recycled  using sustainable membrane technologies (solvent recycling) and mention 10.1016/j.jcat.2019.01.041 example.10. The conclusion section should briefly mention the main limitations and drawbacks of the proposed catalysts, as well as the novelty of the presented work in relation to the existing literature.11.

Using a state-of-the-art mobile observation platform that includes instrumentation mounted on light rail trains (Mitchell et al., 2018) and a news helicopter (Blaylock, Horel, & Crosman, 2017), large spatial and temporal gradients in pollutant concentrations have been observed across Salt Lake County. The health impacts of poor air quality in Utah range from high incidences of pneumonia (Pirozzi et al., 2018), to increased hospitalizations due to respiratory issues (Horne et al., 2018). Furthermore, emerging associations between poor air quality and negative health outcomes such as pre-term births (Hackmann & Sj\u00f6berg, 2016) and suicides (Bakian et al., 2015) have been found in the Salt Lake Valley and Utah, furthering the importance of pollutant reduction strategies.'

To address the lack of demographic representation among participants, subsequent expansion efforts should include more direct engagement with trusted members of the targeted communities and stronger attempts to engage participants in energy efficiency education.'.

Other methods include but are not limited to biochemical method [11], molecular sieving [12,13], and low-temperature fractionation [14,15]. Among those technologies listed above, chemical absorption is the most widely used method for acid gas removal. Various amines have been commonly used as chemical solvents, such as monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), and methyldiethanolamine (MDEA). Compared with MEA and DEA, MDEA can selectively remove H2S with the existence of CO2. Secondly, MDEA can remove most CO2 and H2S from the raw natural gas, it can be beneficial to sulfur recovery. Thirdly, the foaming tendency and corrosiveness of MDEA are lower compared to MEA and DEA. Last but not least, the reaction of MDEA with CO2 is an acid-base reaction with less heat of reaction, thus less heat is needed during regeneration, so it is ideal for removing CO2 in large quantities [16-18].'.
