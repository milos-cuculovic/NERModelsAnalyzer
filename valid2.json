Authors answered this issue but they did not specify it in their manuscript. Such choice is a very important bias, as the choice is neither random nor based on any criteria. Is should be extensively described  and in my previous review, I have indicated what should be specified  in Materials and Methods section: how were the diets described to participants, was there any special presentation of diets before a choice, which features were presented, who did present diets, was there any possibility to change ones mind, etc. If Authors state that participants choose diet on their own, that must present the detailed procedure influencing  the choice.Abstract:Authors should justify their study \u2013 indicate why did they plan to conduct the study exactly in athletes on ketogenic diet (what was the need).Authors should precisely describe the obtained data with the specific results.Materials and Methods:The characteristics of diets should be presented  \u2013 the nutritional value and content of products from a specific groups \u2013 not for a specific days (as in the previously published studies) but the mean values as they are crucial to interpret the presented data. \u2013 Authors stated that it is presented in lines 86-93 but it is not.

{"text": "\u00d8 Lines 63-73, the 'Introduction' section. 'Several studies have focused on the wintertime elevated PM2.5 (Baasandorj et al., 2017; Bares et al., 2018) and summertime elevated ozone (Horel et al., 2016; Lareau et al., 2012) levels in the Salt Lake Valley. Using a state-of-the-art mobile observation platform that includes instrumentation mounted on light rail trains (Mitchell et al., 2018) and a news helicopter (Blaylock, Horel, & Crosman, 2017), large spatial and temporal gradients in pollutant concentrations have been observed across Salt Lake County. The health impacts of poor air quality in Utah range from high incidences of pneumonia (Pirozzi et al., 2018), to increased hospitalizations due to respiratory issues (Horne et al., 2018). Furthermore, emerging associations between poor air quality and negative health outcomes such as pre-term births (Hackmann & Sj\u00f6berg, 2016) and suicides (Bakian et al., 2015) have been found in the Salt Lake Valley and Utah, furthering the importance of pollutant reduction strategies.'

The literature review of the cited papers has been performed mostly in the following manner: 'Membrane separation is another method has been used for natural gas sweetening [7-10]. Other methods include but are not limited to biochemical method [11], molecular sieving [12,13], and low-temperature fractionation [14,15]. Among those technologies listed above, chemical absorption is the most widely used method for acid gas removal. Various amines have been commonly used as chemical solvents, such as monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), and methyldiethanolamine (MDEA). Compared with MEA and DEA, MDEA can selectively remove H2S with the existence of CO2. Secondly, MDEA can remove most CO2 and H2S from the raw natural gas, it can be beneficial to sulfur recovery. Thirdly, the foaming tendency and corrosiveness of MDEA are lower compared to MEA and DEA. Last but not least, the reaction of MDEA with CO2 is an acid-base reaction with less heat of reaction, thus less heat is needed during regeneration, so it is ideal for removing CO2 in large quantities [16-18].'.

However, the correlation between daily wind speed, wind direction and temperature is less easy to observe.

On the basis of load characteristics\u2019 analysis for e-bus charging station, FC is adopted to extract samples on similar days, which can not only avoid the blindness of selecting  similar days by experience, but also overcome the adverse effects of unconventional load data caused by sudden change of factors on training. Then, the author employs WPA with good global convergence and computational robustness in order to optimize the parameters of LSSVM. Consequently, in the paper is developed a hybrid load forecasting model for quick-change e-bus charging station, namely FC-WPA-LSSVM.

'Software trustworthiness is the ability of software to satisfy user expectation with its behaviors and results and to still provide continuous services by disturbances [1].

Software trustworthiness measurement describes how to determine the trustworthy degree of software based on the given trustworthy attributes\u2019 values and their weight values. It can provide a basis for guiding and improving  the trustworthiness of design and implementation of software. Therefore, software trustworthiness measurement becomes one of the core scientific problems in the researching on software trustworthiness [1]. Many software trustworthiness measures based on trustworthy attributes are established, including questionnaires and statistical analysis [8,9], axiomatic approaches [10\u201316], evidence theory [17], supervised machine learning [18], maximum entropy and grey decision-making method [19], software behaviour entropy [20], system testing [21], social-to-software framework [22], crowd wisdom [23], heuristic-systematic processing model [24], users feedback [25], STRAM (Security, Trust, Resilience, and Agility Metrics) [26], etc.' I consider that it is not appropriate for the manuscript to cover 26 (like the authors have did) or even more scientific works in a few lines just for the sake of obtaining an appropriate size of the References section.

The literature review of the cited papers has been performed in the following manner: 'A significant part of these systems in the EU, and most of them in Poland, are extremely worn-out [1\u20133]. They are not efficient and produce considerable amounts of impurities and pollutants which have a negative effect on the environment [4,5]. [\u2026] They do not reduce emission of pollutants generated by technological systems of heat sources [6,7]. [\u2026] Solutions with recuperators can include devices installed as separate elements of the technological system of the heat source [8\u201311] or devices which constitute an integral part of the combustion chamber, e.g., in condensing boilers [11,12]. Recently, systems with compressor or sorption heat pumps for the recovery and reuse of waste heat have been used most frequently [13,14]. An interesting concept of using an adsorption heat pump for reusing the heat generated by a district heating system in the summer period, when the heat is treated as waste heat, was discussed in [15]. However, the solutions for heat recovery with the use of recuperators and/or heat pumps do not in any way affect changes in the combustion gas composition, thus they do not contribute to the reduction of environmental burden caused by heat sources. This is a serious disadvantage of these solutions in comparison to the installation described herein, which enhances energy efficiency of boilers and reduces emission of pollutants and impurities, including solid impurities. Methods of improving control systems in heating boilers are also often applied in order to enhance energy efficiency of heat sources [16\u201319]. [\u2026] This has a negative effect on the costs and time required for the modernization of control systems [20\u201322].' (Lines 17-42).
